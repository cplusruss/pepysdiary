This is the earliest letter in the sequence of correspondence which could be located, and was oddly omitted by Tanner (1929; it perhaps went unnoticed because E's name is tucked tightly into the bottom left corner of the page). It is implicit, though, from the content of this letter that P had some personal knowledge of E. P had certainly witnessed and recorded E's paper on bread-making at the Royal Society on the preceding <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/03/01/\">1 March</a> (diary) but does not mention E by name. Prior to that both had recorded their presence (diaries) at the launching of the double-bottomed Experiment at Deptford on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/12/22/\">22 December 1664</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be noted that Evelyn, Clifford, Reymes, and Doyly signed a document dated 24 November 1664 addressed to the Commissioners of the Navy, in which they requested details of ships at sea to restrict claims for relief of the sick and wounded to those \"as shall really suffer in His Majesties service\". The document was endorsed by P (Sotheby's Catalogue for 24 July 1995, Lot 488).</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"fn1-1665-04-27-l1\">MS: '27 Aprill 1665' in lower left margin.

It was a 16-gun vessel, originally the Spanish Bon Jesus, captured in 1658 and sold in 1667. Its name distinguished it from the Gift Major, a 40-gun French ship captured in 1652 (Colledge 1987). <a href=\"#fnr2-1665-04-27-l1\">&#8617;</a></li>\n</ol>",

It describes the horrific conditions in which the sick and wounded seamen and prisoners were suffering. There is no suggestion in P's diary that he responded immediately. However, he wrote to Coventry on 3 October 1665 (NMM LBK/8; Tanner 1929, no. 48), bemoaning the \"Want of money, numbers of prisoners (which the Commissioners for Sick and Wounded have flung upon us) to be fed\" amongst \"our present burthen\".</p>\n\t\t<p>E had also written a letter to Sir William Coventry which described the desperate situation: \"Sir William D'Oylie and my selfe have near ten thousand upon our Care, whiles there seems to be no care of us; who, having lost all our Servants, Officers, and most necessary Assistants, have nothing more left us to expose but our Persons, which are at every moment at the mercy of a raging pestilence... Our prisoners... beg at us, as a mercy, to knock them on the head; for we have no bread to relieve the dying Creatures...\" (BL CLBI.257, dated 2 October 1665, published in various Bray editions of E's diary with correspondence). A further copy of this letter, dated 30 September 1665, in two unknown hands, and not signed in E's name, is at NMM MS AGC20 51/064/11.

And if you find the Estimate considerably to exceede the first Calculation, you will remember it was made to the meridian of London; that the Walles were, both by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">his Majestie</a> and the directions of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1121/\">Principall Officers</a> to be made thicker, and higher; that the Materials, and Worke-men were presum'd to be found much cheaper in the Country; and that the Place and area to build on was suppos'd a Level: But it has fall'n out so much to our prejudice, and beyond all expectation in these particulars; that to commence with the ground, we could not in 4 or 5 miles walking about <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/643/\">Chatham</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/894/\">Rochester</a>, find one convenient spot that would bear a level of 200 foote square, unlesse it were one Field beyond the Dock, in the Occupation of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/\">Mr Commissioner Pett</a> neare the bogg and marsh, which has neither solid foundation, nor fresh-water to it.\n\tThere is a very handsome greene Close at the end of the Long Rope-house towards Chatham; but the declivity is so suddaine and greate to the West, that lesse than a ten-foote raising will not bring it to such a rectitude as that we can lay our plate upon the Wall, which will be a considerable trouble and charge to reforme, as may easily be demonstrated: For either the earth must be so much abated towards the East, or the Wall advanc'd to the height of neere 20 foote, whiles one Extreame of the roofe will touch the superficies of the earth: Besides, the field is not above 150 feet wide: But supposing all this might be encounter'd (as indeede it might with charge) it bordures so neere to the Rope-houses, the Dock, and that ample way leading to it from the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5147/\">Hill-house</a> and Chatham, as might endanger his Majesties people in case of any <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/\">Contagion</a>; because it will be impossible to restraine them from sometimes mingling amongst the Worke-men and others, who have Employment in the Dock, when the Convalescent-men shall be able, or permitted to walk abroad.\n\tThis, and some other difficulties made us quit the thoughts of that otherwise gracefully situated place.

Now, five-hundred sick-persons quarter'd at a Towne in the Victualers and scattered Ale-houses (as the Costome is), will take up at least 160 houses, there being very few of those miserable places which afford accommodation for above 2 or 3 in an house; with, frequently at greate distances, employ of Chirurgeons, Nurses, and Officers innumerable; so as when we have ben distress'd for Chirurgeons, some of them (upon computation) walked 5 or 6 miles every day, by going but from quarter to quarter, and not ben able to visite their patients as they ought: Whereas, in our Hospital, they are continualy at hand: We have essay'd to hire some capacious empty houses, but could never meet with any tollerably convenient; and to have many, or more then one, would be chargeable and very troublesome: By our Infirmary, then we have these considerable advantages.</p>\n\t<p>At 6d per diem each (in the way of Commons), the sick shall have as good, and much more proper and wholesome diet, than now they have in the Ale-houses, where they are fed with trash, and Embezil their monye more to inflame themselves, retard and destroy their Cures out of ignorance or intemperance; whiles a sober Matron governs the Nurses, lookes to their provisions, Rollers, Linnen etc. And the nurses attend the Sick, Wash, Sweepe, and Serve the Offices, The Coock and Laundrer comprehended in the number, and at the same rate, etc. By this Method likewise are the almost indefinite number of Chirurgeons and Officers exceedingly reduc'd; The Sick dieted, kept from drinke and Intemperance, and consequently from most unavoydably relapsing: They are hindred from Wandering, Slipping-away, and dispersion: They are more sedulously attended; the Physitian better inspects the Chirurgeons, who neither can nor will be in all places, as now they are scattered, in the nasty Corners of the Townes: They are sooner, and more certainely cur'd (for I have at present neere 30 bedds employ'd in a Barne at Graves-end, which has taught us much of this experience).\n\tThey are receiv'd and discharg'd with infinitely more ease: Our Accompts better and more exactly kept: A vast, and very considerable Summ is saved (not to say gain'd) to his Majestie: The materialls of the house will be good if taken downe; or, if let stand, it may serve in tyme of Peace, for a Store, or Worke-house: The Furniture will (much of it) be useful upon like occasion; And what is to be esteem'd none of the least Virtues of it, 'twill totaly cure the altogether intollerable clamor and difficulties of rude and ungratefull people; their Landlords and Nurses, rays'd by their poverty upon the least obstruction of constant and Weekely payes; for want of which they bring an ill repute upon his Majesties Service, Incense the very Magistrates and better sort of Inhabitants (neighbours to them) who too frequently promote (I am sorry to speake it) their mutinies; so as they have been sometimes menacing to expose our Men in the streetes, where some have most inhospitably perish'd: In fine, This would encounter all Objections whatsoever; is an honorable, Charitable, and frugal Provision; Effectual, full of Encouragement, and very practicable; so as, however for the present it may be consider'd, I cannot but persist in wishing it might be resolv'd upon towards Autumne at the farthest;\n\tChatham and Rochester alone having within 17 or 18 monethes cost his Majestie full \u00a313,000 in cures and quarters; halfe whereof, would have neere ben saved had this method ben establish'd: Add to this, the almost constant station of his Majesties shipps at the Buoy in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/\">the Noore</a>, and river of Chatham; the Clamor of that place against our quartering these, this crazy tyme, and the altogether impossibility of providing else-where for such numbers as continualy presse in upon us there, more than any where else, after Action, or the returne of any of his Majesties fleete: which, with what has ben Offer'd, may recommend this Project, by your favourable representation of the premises, for a permanent Establishment in that Place especially, if his Majestie and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Royal Highnesse</a> so thinke meete.

You will easily be acquainted with the best Painters, especially Le Brun, who is the Chief of them; and it would not be amiss to be present at their Academie, in which Monsieur du Bosse (a principal Member) will conduct you. For the rest, I recommend you to God Almighty's Protection, augure you a happy Journey; and kissing your Lady's Hands, remain,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p>Sir, Your most humble and obedient Servant,</p>\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/\">J Evelyn</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-postscript\">\n\t<p>These 3 Letters I enclose to be presented according to the Directions; with many more I could burthen you; but your short Stay at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8787/\">Paris</a> will not require it; and besides, being Persons of great Quality, much of your time would be consum'd in making and repaying but impertinent Visites, in which I believe you would not willingly engage.

Therefore you may please to enquire for One Hughs an Englishman, who lives in <em>la Rue de la Boucherie, au Fauxborg St Germain</em>, a Friend of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5803/\">Sir Samuel Tuke</a>s, who will send for Dr Fitz-Gerrard (to whom you have a Letter) and he will assist you both to find out a fit Lodging, and whatever else you shall require.<sup id=\"fnr6-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn6-1669-08-21-l1\">6</a></sup></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-body\">\n\t<p>Sir,<sup id=\"fnr7-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn7-1669-08-21-l1\">7</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>If you make your Journey through Picardy (which I believe you may resolve to do in regard of the Contagion) if you could so contrive it as to see Monsieur de Lion-Court's Seat at Lion-Court, the Gardens and Water-works would much please you; at least, if they are continu'd with that Care we have knowne them. But because I cannot tell you how inconvenient it may prove to deviate so far from your direct Road, I do only mention it <em>en passant</em>.</p>\n\t<p><em>Calais</em><sup id=\"fnr8-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn8-1669-08-21-l1\">8</a></sup> You will find a strong Town by the new Fortifications and by two adjoyning Forts, besides the Citadelle and the Sluces, by which they can environ it with water at pleasure. The Market-place and Magazine, which was once a Staple for English Wool is observable; and so is the Architecture of an Altar-piece (as I take it) of black marble. I us'd to lodge at the Silver Lyon. Hence you have 7 Leagues to <em>Boulogne</em> a small Town; but famous for our Henry 8's Expedition. The Lower Town has a large Street, and there I suppose you may lodge <em>au Bras d'or</em>. The Fortifications are not considerable. After 7 Leagues riding you will come to</p>\n\t<p><em>Montreuil</em>, where you will see an irregular Citadel; but the Town situated on a strong Eminence; and towards Paris-side the Fortification is very considerable by an Horn-work, and most noble Bastions, which are worth Remark, and will give you an idea of the Strength of such Places as they fortify abroad.</p>\n\t<p><em>Abbeville</em> -- is 10 Leagues, a reasonable pretty Town; and though it be well fortify'd, there is nothing very observable in it. Here they used to offer us Pistols and Guns to buy. I think you will lodge there, or proceed 4 Leagues further to</p>\n\t<p><em>Pont Dormis.</em> A Little strong-Place regularly fortify'd. Thence to Crevecoeur 4 Leagues: And thence to</p>\n\t<p><em>Poix</em> Where you come into wretched Places, till you arrive at</p>\n\t<p><em>Beauvais</em> 9 Leagues (as I remember) a pretty large Town, and Market-place, and well-water'd: The Houses built of Wood. The Bishop's House is of Stone, and has some good Appartments in it. The Church is imperfect; but the Architecture good, though plain, and with handsome Sculpture behind the Quire. Pray observe the measures of the Town for their Serges<sup id=\"fnr9-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn9-1669-08-21-l1\">9</a></sup>), and the Standards of them by Iron-Chains of different Lengths. After 8 Leagues you come to</p>\n\t<p><em>Beaumont</em>. Here, and before you will enter among the Vine-yards, I know little more observable, except it be the House and Garden of the President Nicolais, as you draw near Paris; which I esteem much for the Avenue and Fountains. But your mind will be so set on Paris, which is now but 4 leagues distant, that you will hardly stay. And indeed this whole Journey will render you little satisfaction, being for the most part, through a Frontier and miserable Country, and where you will see part of the Calamity of a Tyrannical Government, and the Effects of a continual War, such as has afflicted all that Tract for diverse Years. When you are arrived at</p>\n\t<p><em>Paris</em>, My Counsel is, that you take Chambre <em>garnie</em><sup id=\"fnr10-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn10-1669-08-21-l1\">10</a></sup> (as they call it). Sir Samuel Tukes addresses you to a Friend of his, an Irish Doctor of Physick (unknown to me) who he assures will be so honest, humble, and necessary to you, that you shall need no other to conduct you to all the considerable Places, and to introduce you both at the Courts and other Assemblys, which it is necessary for you to see. He will likewise find you out a convenient place for your Lodging, and do the Offices of a Guide in all that you can desire; and which will therefore much shorten the trouble I was going to engage you in, by giving you any large Directions of my owne-</p>\n\t<p>That yet, this Paper may serve to put you in mind of some Particulars, which happly the shortness of your Expedition may otherwise indanger you to omit. I would in the first place climb-up into St Jacques Steeple to take a synoptical Prospect of that monstrous City, to consider the Situation, extent, and Approaches; so as to be the better able to make Comparisons with our London; which you will do with pleasure, by imagining it extended to a Length which you will find in a Circle.<sup id=\"fnr11-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn11-1669-08-21-l1\">11</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>The principall Places where Persons of Quality dwell are in the Sub-urbs, especially that of St Germains, and in that the Abbey, an old Foundation, but nothing much remarkable in it. But the Hospital of <em>La Charit\u00e9</em> is worthy your seeing, for the worthy Charity which is every day there exercis'd in so full, so cleanly and devout a manner, as must needs much affect you; especially when you shall have seen the rest of those admirable Foundations, among which you must not forget the <em>Hostel-Dieu</em> near <em>Notre-dame</em>, though it be not altogether so neat and comp[ac]t; yet for the Number and manner of it, very considerable.</p>\n\t<p>There are diverse noble Houses in these Fauxbourgs; but none comparable to that of</p>\n\t<p>Luxembourg call'd <em>le Palais d'Orleans</em>; which for the Fabrick and Garden (now I hear much neglected since the Decease of the best Gardiner in the World, the Duke) is exceedingly worthy your frequent Visite. Consider the Building well, and the Extent of the Ground about it, as within so great a City; The Fountains, Walks, Eminency on which it stands; and you will judge it almost as fine as Clarendon-House, whose situation somewhat resembles it. The Duke's Library and Gallery well furnish'd with Books, and incomparable Medals (of which he was the most knowing and curious Person in Europ) together with the Gallery painted by the Hand of Rubens (so as we have none in England, and therefore our Painters know not what belongs to Historical Works) will exceedingly please You, if these Curiosities remain still in the Lustre they did at my Sojourn there.<sup id=\"fnr12-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn12-1669-08-21-l1\">12</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>In the City, the first Place of note is the Louvre, or Court of that Great Monarch. The Galleries, <em>Salle</em> of Antiquities, Printing-house, <em>Monnoye</em><sup id=\"fnr13-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn13-1669-08-21-l1\">13</a></sup>, Gardens of the Thuilleries, Furniture, Architecture, and ten thousand Particulars will take you up a good time here. Besides that you ought to kiss <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/\">the King</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11227/\">Queen's</a> Hands; to see some publick Audience; Observe his Table, his Guard, Council, and what else will be suggested to you by your Conductor. As you go to Court, you will pass over <em>Pont-neuf</em>, and wish ours of London had no more Houses upon it, but instead thereof a Statue, such as you will there find erected, the Work of the famous Giovanni de Bologna, greatly esteem'd<sup id=\"fnr14-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn14-1669-08-21-l1\">14</a></sup> the foot of this Bridge (for the River is not considerable) there was a Water-work called the <em>Samaritaine</em>, and in my time such a curious and rich Piece of Artificial Rock-Work, as was hardly to be seen in Europ. But the curious Person that then was Master of it, is since many years dead, and perhaps the Rock demolish'd and sold: It is but asking the Question. However one would see the Machine.<sup id=\"fnr15-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn15-1669-08-21-l1\">15</a></sup></p>\n\t<p><em>Notre-Dame</em> is the Chief Church of Paris, built (as Tradition goes) by the English, but infinitely inferiour to St Pauls, or Westminster. You will do well to consider it, if the Giant at the Entry do not forbid you<sup id=\"fnr16-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn16-1669-08-21-l1\">16</a></sup>. There are some Pictures in it considerable.</p>\n\t<p>Near this is the <em>Pont au Change</em>, which though but short, is for the uniformity of the Houses and Bass-relieve of Brass at the front of it, pretty in perspective.</p>\n\t<p>You will be much entertain'd in visiting the several Convents of the &lt;Orders of Fryers and other Religious Men: One would therefore see the&gt;<sup id=\"fnr17-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn17-1669-08-21-l1\">17</a></sup> Convents of the Franciscans, Capucines, Fathers of the Oratory, and above all the Jesuites, both that of the Novitiate in the Suburbs near Luxembourg, for the trueness of the Architecture, and though plain, yet very excellent and that of St Louis, more splendid and costly. And you must not only behold the Out-side, but procure Admission within to see their manner of living, which will bee wholly new to You; especially that of the Carthusians, which I conjure you not to omit; and to visit likewise a Nunnery or two, not forgetting Sion, and the Monument of Sir Samuel Tukes's Lady.<sup id=\"fnr18-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn18-1669-08-21-l1\">18</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>When among the several Churches and Oratories you shall have once contemplated the <em>Val de Grace</em>, your Eyes will never desire to behold a more accomplished Piece<sup id=\"fnr19-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn19-1669-08-21-l1\">19</a></sup>. There it is you will see the utmost effects of good Architecture and Painting, and heartily wish such another stood where once <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/\">St Pauls</a> was, the boast of our Metropolis; for than this, you will never see a more noble (though not great Fabrick;) the Co[n]vent and other Buildings about it are very compleat, especially the Carmes over against it.</p>\n\t<p>After the Churches and Hospitals, remember the University, particularly the Sorbonne: The Schools are a plain Building, but the Church is a noble Structure, and the melancholy Situation of it within the Court, has some what (methinks) of particular in it, which affects me. Here, be sure to be at some publick Scholastical Exercise, and love our owne Universitys the better after it.</p>\n\t<p>There is <em>le College des quatre Langues</em> founded by Cardinal Mazarin, but not yet finish'd, worthy your Enquiry after: And if his Majesty have done any thing for the Virtuosi (our Emulators) in designing &lt;them&gt; a Mathematical College, seek after it, and procure to be admitted into their present Assembly, that you may render our Society an Account of their Proceeding. You will easily obtain that by the assistance of some Friend: But Mr Oldenburg being in the Country, (for I went to his House) you will miss of an infallible Address.</p>\n\t<p>Now you must be sure to be early at some famous Aacdemy to see the Gentlemen ride the Great Horse, and their other Exercises, that you may be astonish'd a great Kingdom as ours, and so great a City as London, should not afford one <em>Cavalerizio</em> for the noblest Institution of Youth; there being so many in Paris, and in almost all the considerable Citys of France, which daily ride near an hundred managed Horses.</p>\n\t<p>When you visit <em>le Palais Cardinal</em>, You will find many things worth your seeing, especially the Galeries and the Paintings; the King and Queen's Bathing-Rooms, Chambers of Audience; Theater for the Comedies, Gardens, and near it Cardinal Mazarin's Palace, at my being in Paris, and in his Life-time, doubtless the most richly furnish'd in the World.</p>\n\t<p>I suppose the Library is yet extant: You must by all means see it, as one of the most considerable things in Paris &lt;but the King has a Library well worth your seeing near Monsieur Colbert's house&gt;. But what is of greater Antiquity, and to be reverenc'd for being so, is, the <em>Abbey de St Victoire</em> whose Bibliotheque is very remarkable. But infinite are the Collections of rare Books, Pictures, Statues, Curiositys etc, which the Noblemen and many private Persons have in Paris; which daily augmenting and diminishing, according to the genius of the Possessors of them, you must enquire after upon the Place, and procure means of seeing: For which I transmit you the 3 Enclos'd Letters to Friends of mine (though of the lower Rank) who will abundantly satisfy your Curiosity; and you will do well to purchase of them what they have of most rare of their own Works, as well Books as Tailles-Douces; the One being the most famous Artist for things in Graving with the Burin, and the other in Etching. Monsieur Du Bosse's Books of Architecture and Perspective etc are worthy your Collections<sup id=\"fnr20-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn20-1669-08-21-l1\">20</a></sup>. And if you stayd so long to have your Lady's and your own Pictures engraven by le Chevalier de Nanteuille you would bring home Jewels not to be parallel'd by any Mortal at present, and perhaps by none hereafter. He is the greatest Man that ever handl'd the Graver, and besides, he is a Scholar and a well-bred Person<sup id=\"fnr21-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn21-1669-08-21-l1\">21</a></sup>. And Monsieur Du Bosse (the other) is a plain, honest, worthy, and intelligent good man; both my Singular Friends and Correspondents for those Matters of Art etc.</p>\n\t<p>The King's medicinal Garden and Laboratory with all the Apparatus, is at no hand to be omitted, because it is so well furnish'd and so rarely fitted for the Design, as having all the affections of Ground and Situation desirable. If you stayd a whole Winter in Paris, I would invite you to see a Course of Chimistry, which is both there and in several private Places shew'd to the Curious to their wonderful satisfaction and Benefit of Philosophic Spirits.</p>\n\t<p>Near to this is the Gobelins, where was wont to be the Manufacture of Tapestry; pray enquire it out most diligently, and by no means omit the visiting of all those Particulars; no, not Monsieur Colbert's late Silk-Worm-Work, or whatever there be of that Nature. &lt;At these Gobelins are all the King's Manufactures: Pray therefore visit it most studiously.&gt;</p>\n\t<p>You must likewise see the <em>Hostel de Ville</em>, being their Guild-Hall, the Palais (which is their Exchange) and there the Hall of Justice; answerable to ours of Westminster, neater, but not so large, especially the Parliament-Chamber, and other Tribunals, which you will find to be much more august and splendid than most of ours. Here you will take notice of the Habits of their Advocates and Men at Law, and be curious to hear a Pleading, as well as a Masse and other Ceremomies at some of the Churches, that you may love your own Religion the better.</p>\n\t<p>The <em>Place Royal</em> is our Piazza of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/126/\">Covent-Garden</a>; but in my judgement nothing so chearful. The Brazen Horse in it is considerable.</p>\n\t<p>By some especial Favour you may be admitted to take a View of the Bastille (which is their <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/\">Tower</a>) and Arsenal joyning to it. There you will see in what Equipage for Strength they are; for there they cast their great Guns, and there is the Repository of Stores. There are many noble Houses and pretty Oratories here-about, especially St Louis belonging to the Jesuites, with a Noble Frontispice.</p>\n\t<p>For once you would be at the Preach at Charenton, and for once see a publick Comedy at <em>l'Hostel de Bourgogne</em>, and even the Mad-men at the <em>Petites-Maisons</em>: For all these Places and Humours are instructive; but none more <em>Divertissant</em> than the Mountebanks and prodigious Concourse of Mankind au <em>Pont-Neuf</em><sup id=\"fnr22-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn22-1669-08-21-l1\">22</a></sup>, which I would therefore have you frequently to traverse, and contemplate, as a lively Image of that Mercurial Nation.</p>\n\t<p>In the <em>St Chappel</em> are some Reliques<sup id=\"fnr23-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn23-1669-08-21-l1\">23</a></sup> which you may also see, when you are at the <em>Palais</em>; and be sure to bring home with you some good French Books, which you will encounter in you visiting their Shops.</p>\n\t<p>The <em>Cours</em> you should likewise see, to compare it with our Assemblys of Gallants and Faire Ladys at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/719/\">Hide-Park</a>: And then I know not what to say more; for by this time you will be willing to take some air perhaps abroad, and make a Journey about the Town, to see how they live in the Countrey, and how they make their <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/\">Wine</a> (for the Vintage almost meets you) among their Villa's. The Places I recommend to your view are chiefly,</p>\n\t<p>St Cloud, those noble Gardens, where you will kiss the Hand of Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans<sup id=\"fnr24-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn24-1669-08-21-l1\">24</a></sup>. Ruel, formerly a most elegant Villa<sup id=\"fnr25-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn25-1669-08-21-l1\">25</a></sup>. <em>St Germain-en-Laye</em>, one of the King's Countrey-Houses, nobly situated, and where there were the most Artificial Water-Works and Grotts in France, now I hear run exceedingly to decay. <em>Maisons</em> in my poor Judgment for the Architecture, Situation, cutt into the River, Forest, Gardens, Stables, etc, one of the most accomplish'd and sweet Abodes that ever I saw: But it is not perfect. Madrid is not very considerable; but one <em>Appartment</em> at Bois St Vincennes is worth your view, with the Park; of which you will find none comparable to ours in England. St Denys, I suppose, you might see in your Journey going or returning; and there, besides a venerable Church, the Dormitory of the French Kings, a Treasury of Reliques emulating even that of our Lady's of Loretto, and you must not omit it.</p>\n\t<p>I would have you also make a step to Arcueil, which Mary of Medicis built for an Aqu\u00e6duct; because it will furnish you with an Idea what those stupen-dious structures were extended to many miles, and of greater Altitude only.</p>\n\t<p>Chantilly, Melun, Verneuil, Monceaux, Villers Cotteret, Limours, Bois le Vicomte<sup id=\"fnr26-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn26-1669-08-21-l1\">26</a></sup>, Bisestre, an Hospital, are Countrey-Palaces and Gardens of great Fame, if your time serve you may do well to visit. &lt;Many of these Places will be too far for you.&gt; But at no hand must you forget to take a th[o]rough Survey of their renowned Fontainebleau; which when you have seen you will not judge comparable to Hampton-Court; nor can the French Monarch shew such a Castle, Palace, and Church, as our Windsor in all his wide Dominions. Yet here the Canal, and plenty of Water, with the Forest &lt;about it&gt; is stupendious; and there are some good Paintings in the House; but especially that Gallery, the Work of the famous Prima Titia.</p>\n\t<p>Versailles will much please you; and Veau, the House of the late President Fouquet, amaze you for the infinite Cost both in Building and Gardens, august even in its very Ruines, and absence of its magnificent Founder.</p>\n\t<p>I had forgott to acquaint you that the Church-yard of St Innocents in Paris is observable for the Quality of the Earth, which by the innumerable Buryings there, is become Sarcophagus; and there it is you will see the Hieroglyphics of the Philosophie Works of Nicolas Flamel; but in nothing beautifull or considerable.</p>\n\t<p>I should not have so slightly mention'd <em>les Carmes</em>, a Church near Val de Grace, because it is most worthy your seeing, and particularly the Tabernacles upon the High Altar.</p>\n\t<p>In the English College of Jesuites, Clermont, you will see the Systems of Copernicus, and the new Astronomers, moved by Water; For the rest, the Place is nothing observable.</p>\n\t<p>Sir, Had I anything more to add, I should weary you; it is already late, and I almost blind: So as I am perfectly asham'd at my wretched Character.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p>J E<sup id=\"fnr27-1669-08-21-l1\"><a href=\"#fn27-1669-08-21-l1\">27</a></sup></p>\n</div>",

The distinct duty of whose place as <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/484/\">Clerk of the Acts</a> being not to be denied to have shared in the increase of trouble occasioned by a war, equal (at least) to that of any of my fellows, especially those of them who, standing charged with little of the active, were at more leisure to attend only the consultive part of the Office, I cannot conceive any person conversant in the business thereof will scru-ple to allow the well executing my single share thereinfor a task sufficient to exercise the best industry of one man, without the additional charge of an accountableness for the reasons and actions of others.</p>\n\t<p>To give your Lordships therefore a summary account of the method wherein I have in my particular place endeavoured to discharge my duty to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">his Majesty</a>, both in the diligence of my attendance on it, the effects of my performance of it, and upright-ness in both, give me leave to say:</p>\n\t<p>First -- That for what respects my diligence: as no concernments relating to my private fortune, pleasure or health did at any time (even under the terror of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/\">the Plague</a> itself) divide me one day and night from my attendance on the business of my place, so was I never absent at any public meeting of this Board but upon the especial commands of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">the Lord High Admiral</a>, and that not thrice during the whole three years of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13153/\">the war</a>. To which let me add that in my endeavours after a full performance of my duty I have neither made distinction of days between those of rest and others, nor of hours between them of day and night, being less acquainted during the whole war with the closing my day's work before midnight than after it.</p>\n\t<p>And that your Lordships may not conceive this to arise from any vain assumption of what may be grounded more upon the inability of others to disprove than my own capacity to justify, such have ever been my apprehensions both of the duty and importance of my just attendance on his Majesty's service that among the many thousands under whose observation my employ-ment must have placed me, I challenge any man to assign one day from my first admission to this service in July 1660 to the determination of the war August 1667 (being a complete apprenticeship) of which I am not at this day able upon oath to give an account of the particular manner of my employing the same.</p>\n\t<p>Secondly -- That although this resignation of my whole time and strength to the service of his Majesty might in other cases be admitted for the equallest method of rating my performances, and albeit that other, by which alone your Lordships seem inclined to measure the same, namely the exactness of their conformity to and compliance with the ancient Instructions of the Lord High Admiral, calculated for a time of peace and small action, will not (I conceive) either in the reason, practicableness or intention thereof be upon examination insisted upon as such during a war, yet to the end that when your Lordships shall find me reasonably urging the same in behalf of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/\">the Board</a> in general, you may not apprehend me interested in the behalf of that argument from any use I have to make of it in reference to my particular, to whom the meanest article of a <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1121/\">Navy Officer's</a> duty ever seemed of too much moment to be left unexecuted without the communication of it and the reasons thereof to the Lord High Admiral, let it not be thought ostentation for me to own the result of my humble labours in his Majesty's service by pretending to the having stric-tly answered every part  of those  Instructions incumbent on myself; and that in such method as to be willing to submit the same (while under the most tumultuous difficulties of a war) to be compared with and censured by what can be found of most methodical in any of my predecessors during the most leisurely time of peace, though (to say more) your Lordships shall at the same time find the work of my place to have exceeded by little less than a tenfold proportion that of my predecessors in the busiest time of their war. Wherein your Lordships are humbly referred to the written evidences of both, now extant.</p>\n\t<p>And yet, that after having thus acquitted myself in my particu-lar duty I may not be found unmindful of what your Lordships seem to expect from each member in the justification of the acts of the whole, I shall take upon me further to say that though the fullness of my proper employment may (I doubt not) be reason-ably offered in defence of my necessary concurrence with others in matters foreign thereto, yet forasmuch as through the frequent absences of my fellow Officers during the late war (and that sometimes for weeks together) hundreds of letters and warrants have for the dispatch of his Majesty's service been necessarily issued under my single hand and advice, I shall alone undertake for every such act, without the support of any defence for the possible imperfections thereof, deducible from my want of their advice, who stood equally obliged to an attendance with me on the same.</p>\n\t<p>Nay further, forasmuch as though in the quality of my employ-ment it hath in an especial manner been esteemed my part to subscribe to the determinations of the Board, it may have so happened that my advice has nevertheless taken place in matters where one only of my fellow Officers may with myself have been present at the debates, I am contented also to stand personally accountable for every such act of this Office vouched but by one hand more than my own; leaving to your Lordships the consider-ing how far you will expect the like from me in cases where I shall be found subscribing only to the resolutions of a greater number, and those either by the nature or leisure of their proper places more concerned for and better instructed to guide the Board then and justify it now in the reasonableness of the same.</p> \n\t<p>Thirdly -- That as I expect not that either my diligence or best performances should be held worthy owning otherwise than as they are accompanied with integrity to my master and fair dealing towards those whom his service hath led me to have to do with, so I do with good assurance desire the whole world to allege one instance to the prejudice of the same, having the comfort of being able to affirm that my conscience in its strictest retrospections charges me not with any wilful declension from my duty, either in the faithfulness of my deportment therein, or care of rendering it the least expenseful to his Majesty - the execution of my place (under the utmost pressures of the war and the necessary increase of charge attending it) being to be found of less cost to his Majesty by one half than any other branch of the work of this Office, or what (by the necessary latitude given me with the rest of my fellows on that behalf) I might without censure have rend-ered my own to have been, and thereby not only gratified myself with a greater leisure of attending my private concernments, but prevented that untimely ruin of my eyes by the constancy of their night services during the war, which renders the remainder of my life of much less content or use to me than can be supplied by any other satisfaction than what flows from the consideration of that duty to his Majesty to which I sacrificed them.</p>\n\t<p>And as to my behaviour towards others in reference to those gratifications which both practice and the quality of my place might justify an expectation and acceptance of, when (by the direction of the Lord High Admiral or the Board) employed in matters of lawful favour to private men, especially while the trust and burden of my place falling short of none of my fellows, no other reason than the consideration of such advantages incident thereto has been ever assigned for that difference of encourage-ment current amongst us by which the wages of the Clerk of the Acts stands inferior not only to what attends the lowest of his fellow Officers but to the avowed profits of some of their serv-ants, I shall with the same openness and truth wherewith your Lordships have in every other matter (relating no less to myself than others) found me ready to assist your inquiries humbly say:</p>\n\t<p>First -- That from the first hour of my serving his Majesty in this employment I did never to this day directly or indirectly demand or express any expectation of fee, gratuity or reward from any person for any service therein by me done or to be done them.</p>\n\t<p>Secondly -- That no gratuity, though voluntarily offered, hath ever met with my acceptance where I found not the affair to which it did relate accompanied with the doing right or advantage to his Majesty.</p>\n\t<p>Thirdly -- That the sums wherein I stand at this day in disburse on occasions wholly relative to the execution of my said employment during the war, and which (amounting to above \u00a3400) my fellow Officers have in their respective places either not at all known, or been reimbursed the same from his Majesty, do far exceed whatever profits have accrued to me from my said employment within that whole time.</p>\n\t<p>Fourthly -- Lastly, that I have in this place been in general so little solicitous in the study of my private fortune as to own with fullest and most humble thankfulness the favour and bounties of his Majesty to me under my low endeavours therein; though in exchange for near ten years' service, and those the most valuable of my life for such improvements, I find not my estate at this day bettered by one thousand pounds from all the profits, salary or other advantages arising from my said employment beyond what it was known to be at my admission thereto.</p>\n\t<p>Into the truth of all which I do not only invite but pray your Lordships to exercise your strictest inquisitions; being ready to justify the same not only by oath but by a double retribution of every penny or pennyworth of advantage I shall be found to have received either in manner or value different from what I have here declared.</p>\n\t<p>Which leaving with your Lordships as an appendix in my own right to what you have already received from me on behalf of the Board in general, and submitting both to your disposal, I remain,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent\">My Lords and Gentlemen,</p> \n\t<p>Your Lordships' most humble and most faithful servant</p>\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent-2\">S.

Nay, when neither in the balancing storekeepers' accounts, fre-quency of their surveys, tenderness in granting or regularity in clearing imprests, use of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/\">tickets</a> or infallibility in their examin-ations, uninterestedness of their contacts or lowness of their prices, or any other of those circumstances wherein your Majesty's present Officers are deemed most peccant, they will be found to outdo or in many of them even to come up to what hath been arrived at under your Majesty's government. This (I say) seems a concession so injurious to the honour thereof as in faithfulness thereto I durst not in my following discourse permit to pass unreflected on.</p>\n\t<p>Especially when I consider not only the issue of what's past, wherein (as it will ever be in actions like this, while managed but by men and subject to disappointments from <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/\">plague</a>, fire, etc., neither to be foreseen nor obviated) so many real failures must inevitably be looked for as shall not need to be aggravated by the suggestion of others, which indeed are not; but [are] the fatal effects of any miscalculations of the means designed for securing your Majesty's better success to come.</p>\n\t<p>To which mistake I cannot see what can contribute more than an assignment of our present miscarriages to the want of what our predecessors under all their successes were no greater masters of than we; but so much the contrary, that whoever shall have opportunity of taking the same leisurely view of the management of that time which my employment under your Majesty has led me to will easily concur that there appears not anything in the whole conduct of that age to which (under God) their success can be more duly attributed than a steady pursuit of all means conducing thereto, both in preference and exclusion to all impedi-ments arising from considerations either of thrift or method.</p>\n\t<p>Of which, and what else my best observations upon the man-agements and events of these two great actions, together with the collections which by your Majesty's command I have at my late being abroad made on the same subject relating to our neigh-bours, may have furnished me with, improvable to your Majesty's future service, neither my common duty as a subject nor especial obligations as the eldest (though otherwise the least worthy) of your Majesty's servants enjoying at this day the honour of that name in this Office will suffer me to want, much less to let slip, a more fit occasion of exposing to that gracious censure with which your Majesty hath ever been pleased to encourage the humble offers of, Royal Sir,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p>Your Majesty's most loyal, most obedient and faithful</p>\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent\">subject and servant</p>\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent-2\">S.

But I am extremely ashamed to find myself so much outdone by you in kindness, by your not suffering me to know the expense which this business has occasioned you; which I again entreat you to let me do, esteeming your pains, without that of your charge, an obligation greater than I can foresee opportunity of requiting, though I shall by no means omit to endeavour it.

However, we know from a codicil to Pepys's will added in May 1703 that his relationship with Mary Skinner, who became his housekeeper and apparently his common-law wife, had begun thirty-three years earlier -- that is, in or around 1670.</p>\n<p>The letter also thanks Elliot for his assistance in Pepys's attempt to be selected as Parliamentary candidate for Aldeburgh. It seems a faction in Aldeburgh, led by a Mr Duke and Captain Shipman, had opposed Pepys's ambitions and as a result insulted the Duke of York. This was an inevitable matter of concern to Pepys too, since he was loyal to the King's brother and remained so when James succeeded in 1685 with drastic consequences for Pepys when James was deposed in 1688.</p>\n<p>In that letter to Elliot, Pepys makes it clear how ashamed he was Elliot had gone to expense on his behalf. Pepys was extremely conscious of patronage and how the game was played. It was, after all, exactly how he had come to be where he was at the time. He had now reached a position where he was a source of patronage himself.</p>",

I have a brother of my own (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/\">John Pepys</a>), whose relation to me could not tempt me to this motion, were it not that his sobriety, diligence, and education, (being a scholar, and I think in every respect qualified for the employment in a very different proportion to what Mr Ascew's education could render him), doth lead me to think it a service to the Corporation to offer him to them. I aim not so much at the salary for him, as the opportunity, by this means, of introducing him to that unit of business for which I have for some time designed him.

In this letter Pepys writes to John Evelyn's father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne. Browne had been Charles II's envoy to the French court during the Interregnum. Naturally, Pepys had come to know him through Evelyn but also in Browne's involvement with Trinity House.</p>\n<p>London's Trinity House had begun life as a guild of seamen. By the seventeenth century it had become responsible for navigational aids around the coast, such as lights and buoys. Trinity House provided pilots and supervised the certification of sailing masters. It worked closely with the Navy Board, and Pepys, like most of his colleagues, was a member. In fact, Sandwich had been made Master of Trinity House in 1661. Sir Richard Browne donated land to Trinity House to build almshouses at Deptford in 1671, and would himself become Master from 1672-3. Pepys, having heard that the clerk of Trinity House was dead, took the opportunity to recommend his brother John on the basis of his 'sobriety, diligence, and education'. Pepys, who had secured referees from other influential sources including the Duke of York, was of course playing the game. His private opinion of John Pepys was not quite the same. 'I fear he will never make a good speaker -- nor, I fear, any general good scholar' but 'he seems sober, and that pleases me' (Diary 17 October 1666). In 1667 he had considered sending John to Cambridge and making him go into the church. The plans came to nothing and evidently the Trinity House vacancy, Pepys decided, was the opportunity he had been waiting for. He dashed off a letter to Browne, and also sent one to John insisting that he make himself available for interview the following week.</p>\n",

It is that you have of your own head, without precedent, as well as without the advice, or so much as the privity, of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/\">this Board</a> or the Commissioner upon the place, presumed to lay aside the old secure practice of fastening your beams in your new ships with standards and knees, and in the room thereof taken upon you to do it with iron.

He was a comic figure, but with Pepys's patronage his naval career was reasonably successful. He reciprocated Pepys's generosity with his own brand of loyalty, which extended to securing evidence to discredit Pepys's accusers in 1679. Meanwhile, in 1666 Pepys had found him a job as muster-master on the <em>Henry</em>. The job involved maintaining records of personnel, and he handled it satisfactorily, so that by 1670 he was promoted to muster-master at Deal. Several other posts followed but in this letter Balthazar is bringing Pepys up to date with muster administration and news from the coast about the movements of a Dutch vessel. \"Mr Coulmer\" is unknown. The letter illustrates Balthazar's excitable and narcissistic personality.</p>",

            "footnotes": "<p>Pepys seems to have fallen out with the Swedish ambassador in late 1670. The disagreement was bad enough for the possibility of a \"challenge\" between the two men. Duels were a serious matter. In 1662 a Colonel Giles Rawlins was killed in a duel, and Pepys hoped it would lead to \"good laws against it\" (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/08/19/\">Diary 19 August</a>). Sweden had mediated in the peace negotiations that brought about the end of the Second Dutch War as part of the efforts to organize an anti-French coalition. Since Charles II was in debt to Louis XIV for French support during the Interregnum and in other more practical ways, and the English also resented the terms of the peace, the relationship with Dutch and Swedish representatives was necessarily liable to some tension. It is possible that Pepys's loyalty to the crown led him to express a partisan view, or to take offence on behalf of Charles II. In June 1670 Charles II had signed the Treaty of Dover with Louis XIV. This secured for Charles two ports on the mouth of the Scheldt but in a secret version of the same treaty he and the Duke of York agreed to convert to Catholicism and eventually to restore Catholicism to England. Charles II, unlike the Duke of York, kept his own conversion secret. Lord Arlington, secretary of state 1662-74, encouraged this and was himself converted to Catholicism on his own deathbed in 1685. However, there is no clue in this letter from Matthew Wren, secretary to the Duke of York, of what the row was about.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we have no idea what the outcome of the incident was. Pepys seems to have avoided ever making the challenge, which is not wholly surprising as there is no evidence at all to suggest he had any proficiency or interest in the use of weapons himself, though on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/02/02/\">2 February 1662</a> he had started wearing a sword \"as the manner now among gentlemen is\".</p>",

The English and French navies fought the Dutch at Sole Bay on 28 May 1672. The engagement was inconclusive and involved some unfortunate losses. The French lost Rear-Admiral des Rabesni\u00e8res-Treillebois, who was buried at Rochester on 4 June. John Evelyn was one of the pall-bearers and helped organize the ceremony. He was once again serving as a Commissioner for Sick and Wounded Seamen and Prisoners of War in Kent and in regular correspondence with Pepys. The death of the Earl of Sandwich in the battle was also a personal tragedy for Pepys and John Evelyn who called him a 'a true noble man\".</p>\n<p>The Duke of York's secretary, Matthew Wren, was wounded in the battle. There seems to have been some hope that Pepys would succeed him in the post. Pepys wrote to Balthazar St Michel who had clearly expressed his \"hopes\" for Pepys, probably for this promotion. In fact Pepys was never offered the job, and here he warns his brother-in-law not to rely too much on what he can do for him. Balthazar's present employment was still as muster-master at Deal.</p>",

He goes on Monday into Surrey, to return on Tuesday; and perhaps to go with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">the King</a> on Wednesday to the Fleet, where he will receive your letter. It is not doubted but <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13341/\">Sir Robert</a> will have his promised title, though I cannot yet hear that anything is yet done in it. I shall inquire somewhat more closely, and you shall receive what can be collected by, Sir,</p> \n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/\">T.

The potential for corruption is plain from the reference to how the purser was supposed to pay this himself from his own pocket when he was able to do so. James Southerne, then a clerk in the Admiralty, had clearly written to Pepys to clarify what the rates were, what the form was, and to ask for financial assistance to pay the Short Allowances owing. Pepys says he has ordered up some of the new farthings. Copper farthings and halfpennies first went into production in this year of 1672, and were intended to make official small change more readily available in preference to the tokens which were being widely made by merchants. The new copper coins were only legal tender up to a value of sixpence. The \u00a3300 suggested here would have amounted to 288,000 coins weighing 1.67 tons.</p>\n",

Little did I think that the curse I cast on you in drollery, should take place in good earnest for, certainly nothing less than love is able to inspire such noble expressions as yours when you discourse of those persons; who, if any can, deserve them all. But less you could not do in justice, for they are desperately in love with you, and sigh out their passions so charmingly, that I find strange alterations in myself, and 'tis hard to conclude, whether to envy, or pity you. Your enjoyments in their conversation, can nowhere else be found; and theirs is so great, when you entertain them, that they all acknowledge your humour the best in the whole world. Long may you enjoy these happinesses, which I should envy in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">my King</a>, if he were so fortunate, but not in my friend. Your expressions of kindness for me are such that I shall always admire, but can never answer that task I have desired the ladies to undertake, which they may do, being as much assured of my respects for you, as for themselves.</p>\n\t<p>I do most unwillingly mention that misfortune happening lately to your house being unable to say anything suitably, upon so sad an occasion, and less able to declare my concerns for you but, I assure you, my affliction was proportionable to that friendship you are pleased to bestow on me.</p>\n\t<p>Whilst this thought is in my mind, it may be unseasonable to mention one enjoyment I have here, but I beg license to tell you, that we have a little consort among us, which gives us enter-tainment. We have five hands for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/461/\">viols</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/633/\">violins</a>, three of us, use both, and all, except one, the viol, but the want of music in this country obliges us to play over, and over again, some few things I brought from home accidentally, which wears off the relish, so that we are forced to go a-begging to our friends, as I do to you, that if you have anything new, you would bestow it on us and because Mr Monteage (accountant to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/\">Messrs Houblons</a>) intends to present me some things, it may be fit to compare compositions, that they be not duplicates.</p>\n\t<p>Mentioning music puts me in mind to acquaint you, that here is a young man, borne in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/\">Flanders</a>, but bred at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8213/\">Rome</a>, who has a most admirable voice, and sings rarely to his <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/457/\">theorba</a>, and with great skill. This young man lives with a nobleman, upon a very mean salary, and having been formerly in England, most passionately desires to return thither again. If either yourself, or any friend be desirous to favour an ingenious person, I know none more deserving than he. He speaks Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish, and 'tis ten thousand pities to let him live here among people, who will see no virtue but their own; if I were going home, I should entertain him myself, for besides his Parts, he is a very in-genious, and which is more, a very good, and discreet young man.</p>\n\t<p>I have received the whole library you bestow on me for which I give you humble thanks, when the ships are dispatched I shall have time to read a little. Pray present my services to all your kindred, and if the King, and my aunt Maskelyne, afford you a minute, oblige me with a letter. I most affectionately embrace you and remain</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"letter-yours\">\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent\">Dear Sir</p>\n\t<p>Your very faithful and most humble Servant</p>\n\t<p class=\"letter-indent-2\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/\">Tho.

That Morelli was a Catholic was not apparently considered to be a serious issue, though it would become one for Pepys during the Popish Plot of 1679 (see Letters nos. 116 and 117).</p>\n<p>The \"misfortune\" which Hill refers to in the second paragraph of the letter is the fact that on 29 June 1673 the Navy Office in Seething Lane had been destroyed by fire. Ironically, this part of the City had escaped the Great Fire of 1666. Pepys had now had to move to Winchester Street.</p> \n<p>This letter is also one of the first to allude to the convivial and intimate social circle that would dominate much of the rest of Pepys's life. The \"excellent ladies\" are Pepys's friends Elizabeth, Lady Mordaunt, and \"her sister Johnson\", later (or perhaps by now) \"Mrs Steward\" (see Letter no. 230). The letter was in fact dated 14 April since it was sent from the Continent, where the Gregorian calendar was 10 days ahead. Great Britain did not convert until September 1752. The dates given for every letter in this book are by English reckoning in the 1600s, regardless of the date on the actual letter.</p>\n<p>The little note enclosed, is a receipt for a few Gammons, and some of our Hunns water, which I have ordered to be got aboard the Queen's frigate. Pray do me the favor to accept these trifles.</p>",
