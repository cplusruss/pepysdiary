An [1880 photograph of some houses in this street](http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/lewisham/assets/galleries/deptford/flagon-row) has been identified as being contemporary with buildings of the mid to late 1600s and appears to be of the size they occupied. The three Bagwell households -- Owen's, William's and John's -- as well as Alexander Sutherland (together with son William) were all in this street in 1670<sup id=\"fnr11-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn11-id-2012-07-18\">11</a></sup>. The timbered construction suggests that they may have been built by shipyard carpenters. \nBy the time of his death in 1697 William owned numerous items of silver -- tankards, plate, candlesticks, etc.<sup id=\"fnr12-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn12-id-2012-07-18\">12</a></sup> -- commensurate with the then practise of silver gifts being given to master shipwrights. More noticeably, a watch and as an indication of his self-perceived social status, a sword and scabbard. William leaves his entire estate to his wife Elizabeth with allocations to unnamed first cousins and siblings' children in the event of her re-marriage or death<sup id=\"fnr13-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn13-id-2012-07-18\">13</a></sup>. There is no reference to any offspring and no children's baptisms have been found at St Nicholas or elsewhere.\n\n**[Mrs Bagwell](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/)** Although no marriage has yet been traced which would give her maiden name, William's will of 1697<sup id=\"fnr14-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn14-id-2012-07-18\">14</a></sup> refers to \"Elizabeth my well beloved wife\". One of his Trustees, described as \"my kinsman\", is named Owen Sutherland and his name appears again in the 1702 will of Elizabeth Bagwell, Deptford where he is described as \"my husband's kinsman\". Clearly this must be the same person and thus links the two wills together.\n\nElizabeth also refers to her husband's kinsman John Bagwell, and sister Margaret Bagwell. Individuals of these names along with William himself are recorded as being children of Owen and Alice Bagwell and baptised at St Nicholas, Deptford in 1646, 1638 and 1637 (William)<sup id=\"fnr15-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn15-id-2012-07-18\">15</a></sup>. She spreads her possessions out among numerous relatives and friends but again with no mention of offspring. A full list of beneficiaries, witnesses and trustees is below. Copies of both wills can be downloaded from [The National Archives](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/).\n\nThe apparent absence of a marriage record does not necessarily imply that William never married Elizabeth. Records for the 1600s are often patchy and their marriage could have taken place in the interregnum period i.e. to 1660 when recording was particularly bad. It has not been found possible for example to establish family structures of any depth for the many individuals named in the two wills. \n\nIt may also be necessary to treat the term \"kinsman\" on the wills with caution. There are a high number of discreet surnames described as \"kinsman\" on the two wills even allowing for changes of name following marriage. Given the close-knit nature of the Deptford shipbuilding community it may be that the term includes distant relatives or close friends.\n\nElizabeth Bagwell died in 1702 and was buried at St Nicholas, Deptford on 14th August. Her plot could not have been far from that of Pepys' sister-in-law, Hester St Michael, who had been buried there in 1687. Elizabeth's residence was given as Back Lane (as does her will) and her occupation or status as Gent. i.e. Gentlewoman. Those familiar with her past may not feel this description entirely appropriate.  Back Lane's location, roughly New King Street today, can be seen [on this map of 1802](http://www.motco.com/map/81004/SeriesSearchPlatesFulla.asp?mode=query&title=Back+Lane,+Deptford&artist=386&other=284&x=11&y=11).\n\nTwo other candidates for the wife of William have been put forward elsewhere and counter-arguments for these are detailed below.\n\n**John Bagwell*** b.1646. William's younger brother; he married Ann Brognane in 1668 at St Nicolas, Deptford. Three children were born to them over 1671-75. In 1694, ostensibly widowed and childless, John, then a mariner age 48, makes a will prior to going to sea (his mother's will says he's in the Indies). He leaves everything to \"his kinsman\" William Sutherland. Nothing to his still living mother, brother William, sister Margaret or any of his children or wife. This may be connected with the apparently bigamous marriage of \"Anne Bagwell widdow ... of Deptford\" to a William Bailey in 1678 at Holy Trinity, [Minories](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6103/) where many clandestine marriages took place. A court petition<sup id=\"fnr16-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn16-id-2012-07-18\">16</a></sup>  of 16 May 1681 reads \"Anne Bagwell widow ... to John Bagwell Shipwright\" -- and in a subsequent letter she's described as \"Anne Bagwell alias Bayley wife of William Bayley\". John is still alive and it appears she's faking her widowhood. \n\n**Owen Bagwell**, William's father and foreman at Deptford Dockyard gets some illuminating mentions in <cite>The Secret History of His Majesty's Ship-Yard</cite> at Deptford (1718)<sup id=\"fnr17-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn17-id-2012-07-18\">17</a></sup>.\n\n**William Sutherland** b.1668 described as a kinsman in Elizabeth's will, was a nephew of William and was so described in the introduction to his book <cite>The Ship Builders Assistant</cite> first published in 1711. It appears to have become a standard work being re-printed up until 1840<sup id=\"fnr18-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn18-id-2012-07-18\">18</a></sup>. Frustratingly, although he and four siblings were baptised at St Nicholas, Deptford the relationship between his father Alexander and William Bagwell's father Owen has not been discovered. He was apparently a close relative since William B's apparently childless and widowed brother John leaves his entire estate to him.\n\nWilliam seems to have been a man of considerable talent. A National Archives document summary reads:\n\n> William Sutherland, Master Caulker, Sheerness. In 1705 he made a proposal for a method of delineating ships' draughts, using the principles of Sir Isaac Newton and other mathematicians. Surveyor Furzer agreed that the method was good and recommended him to the Board for encouragement, ... In 1710 he made a proposal regarding the planking of ships' bottoms... In 1712 he made proposals for the more efficient use of hand pumps... In his leisure time over the past 30 years he has studied the works of mathematicians and Master Builders and has developed proposals for an entirely new way of building and equipping ships...<sup id=\"fnr19-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn19-id-2012-07-18\">19</a></sup>.\n\nHe died in 1740.\n\n**Owen Sutherland** is named in both William and Elizabeth Bagwell's wills as above. He was the younger brother of William and supplied timber from the New Forest to Portsmouth shipyard<sup id=\"fnr20-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn20-id-2012-07-18\">20</a></sup>.\n\n**Jos(eph) Allin** a witness to William's will. In 1694 he was 2nd assistant Master Shipwright at Portsmouth, then Deptford (1701), [Sheerness](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/) (1704) &amp; [Woolwich](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/) back to Deptford in 1705 as Master Shipwright. In 1708 he had the Master Shipwrights House built there which still survives. He was dismissed from service in 1715 on corruption charges. Commended in the parish records of 1710 for having \"raised the sum of fifty pounds and upwards\" towards the founding of a model school (which was apparently spurned by the shipbuilding community)<sup id=\"fnr21-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn21-id-2012-07-18\">21</a></sup>;  he died in 1716.\n\nHis son, also Joseph, became Master Shipwright, Portsmouth in 1726, went on to become [Surveyor of the Navy](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/486/) and was knighted in 1747. Subsequently his mental health collapsed leading to a commission and inquiry of lunacy in 1758<sup id=\"fnr22-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn22-id-2012-07-18\">22</a></sup>. He died the following year.   \n\nFinally, a fantasy reasoning:\n\n1. Had his wife not engaged with Samuel Pepys then William Bagwell would not have risen to Master Shipwright.\n\n2. Had William not have become a Master Shipwright then he would not have inspired his nephew William Sutherland to write his work on shipbuilding.\n\n3. Had William Sutherland not written his work then shipbuilding techniques would not have been of a quality to enhance us militarily up to and beyond the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n4. Had we not ruled the waves then the British Empire would not have come about.    \n\nShould an overdue epitaph for Elizabeth Bagwell be \"Mother of the Navy\" perhaps? (With apologies to Arthur Bryant.)\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n## Other suggested candidates for Mrs Bagwell\n\n**Anne.** Richard Endsor's book -- <cite>The Restoration Warship</cite> -- advances the case that Mrs Bagwell was named Anne and cites some pay [ticket](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/) dispute papers in which she's named. Her court petition<sup id=\"fnr23-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn23-id-2012-07-18\">23</a></sup>  of 16 May 1681 reads \"Anne Bagwell widow ... to John Bagwell Shipwright\" -- not William -- and in a subsequent letter she's described as \"Anne Bagwell alias Bayley wife of William Bayley\" which leads back to the 1678 marriage referred to above. John Bagwell is not dead as we know although why he apparently became estranged from Anne and possibly his original family is unknown. Clearly however Anne was never William Bagwell's wife.   \n\n**Judith.** A mooted but unlikely candidate is the Judeath (sic) Campion, cited in Richard Ollard's Pepys' biography, who marries a Will (sic) Bagwell at St Botolph's Bishopsgate in June 1660. In 1670 however a Judith (sic) Bagwell, widow of William, is contesting ownership of her late husband's estate in Lincolnshire<sup id=\"fnr24-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn24-id-2012-07-18\">24</a></sup>. Given the relative rarity of the names -- Judith and Bagwell -- it seems reasonable to assume that these are the same people who married in London ten years earlier and that this deceased William is not our eponymous carpenter and shipwright.\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n## Notes\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr1-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn2-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/321/11, 15, 17, 19&amp;c. <a href=\"#fnr2-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn3-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/378 f424 <a href=\"#fnr3-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn4-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/493/50, 53, 55&amp;c. <a href=\"#fnr4-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn5-id-2012-07-18\">Google Books: <cite>A New List of all the ships and vessels of Her Majesties Royal Navy</cite> (1710) <a href=\"#fnr5-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn6-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 23 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr6-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn7-id-2012-07-18\">Unpublished counts of parish register entries and hearth tax returns by the author <a href=\"#fnr7-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn8-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 13 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr8-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn9-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 13 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr9-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn10-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr10-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn11-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr11-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn12-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/466 <a href=\"#fnr12-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn13-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/443 <a href=\"#fnr13-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn14-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/443 <a href=\"#fnr14-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn15-id-2012-07-18\">Two other children -- Owen 1646 (a twin to John) and Owine 1658 -- died in infancy, a third, Alice 1651 marries in 1677 but no trace after that.

One of his Trustees, described as \"my kinsman\", is named Owen Sutherland and his name appears again in the 1702 will of Elizabeth Bagwell, Deptford where he is described as \"my husband's kinsman\". Clearly this must be the same person and thus links the two wills together.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth also refers to her husband's kinsman John Bagwell, and sister Margaret Bagwell. Individuals of these names along with William himself are recorded as being children of Owen and Alice Bagwell and baptised at St Nicholas, Deptford in 1646, 1638 and 1637 (William)<sup id=\"fnr15-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn15-id-2012-07-18\">15</a></sup>. She spreads her possessions out among numerous relatives and friends but again with no mention of offspring. A full list of beneficiaries, witnesses and trustees is below. Copies of both wills can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\">The National Archives</a>.</p>\n<p>The apparent absence of a marriage record does not necessarily imply that William never married Elizabeth. Records for the 1600s are often patchy and their marriage could have taken place in the interregnum period i.e. to 1660 when recording was particularly bad. It has not been found possible for example to establish family structures of any depth for the many individuals named in the two wills. </p>\n<p>It may also be necessary to treat the term \"kinsman\" on the wills with caution. There are a high number of discreet surnames described as \"kinsman\" on the two wills even allowing for changes of name following marriage. Given the close-knit nature of the Deptford shipbuilding community it may be that the term includes distant relatives or close friends.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Bagwell died in 1702 and was buried at St Nicholas, Deptford on 14th August. Her plot could not have been far from that of Pepys' sister-in-law, Hester St Michael, who had been buried there in 1687. Elizabeth's residence was given as Back Lane (as does her will) and her occupation or status as Gent. i.e. Gentlewoman. Those familiar with her past may not feel this description entirely appropriate.  Back Lane's location, roughly New King Street today, can be seen <a href=\"http://www.motco.com/map/81004/SeriesSearchPlatesFulla.asp?mode=query&amp;title=Back+Lane,+Deptford&amp;artist=386&amp;other=284&amp;x=11&amp;y=11\">on this map of 1802</a>.</p>\n<p>Two other candidates for the wife of William have been put forward elsewhere and counter-arguments for these are detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>John Bagwell</strong>* b.1646. William's younger brother; he married Ann Brognane in 1668 at St Nicolas, Deptford. Three children were born to them over 1671-75. In 1694, ostensibly widowed and childless, John, then a mariner age 48, makes a will prior to going to sea (his mother's will says he's in the Indies). He leaves everything to \"his kinsman\" William Sutherland. Nothing to his still living mother, brother William, sister Margaret or any of his children or wife. This may be connected with the apparently bigamous marriage of \"Anne Bagwell widdow ... of Deptford\" to a William Bailey in 1678 at Holy Trinity, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6103/\">Minories</a> where many clandestine marriages took place. A court petition<sup id=\"fnr16-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn16-id-2012-07-18\">16</a></sup>  of 16 May 1681 reads \"Anne Bagwell widow ... to John Bagwell Shipwright\" -- and in a subsequent letter she's described as \"Anne Bagwell alias Bayley wife of William Bayley\". John is still alive and it appears she's faking her widowhood. </p>\n<p><strong>Owen Bagwell</strong>, William's father and foreman at Deptford Dockyard gets some illuminating mentions in <cite>The Secret History of His Majesty's Ship-Yard</cite> at Deptford (1718)<sup id=\"fnr17-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn17-id-2012-07-18\">17</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>William Sutherland</strong> b.1668 described as a kinsman in Elizabeth's will, was a nephew of William and was so described in the introduction to his book <cite>The Ship Builders Assistant</cite> first published in 1711. It appears to have become a standard work being re-printed up until 1840<sup id=\"fnr18-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn18-id-2012-07-18\">18</a></sup>. Frustratingly, although he and four siblings were baptised at St Nicholas, Deptford the relationship between his father Alexander and William Bagwell's father Owen has not been discovered. He was apparently a close relative since William B's apparently childless and widowed brother John leaves his entire estate to him.</p>\n<p>William seems to have been a man of considerable talent. A National Archives document summary reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>William Sutherland, Master Caulker, Sheerness. In 1705 he made a proposal for a method of delineating ships' draughts, using the principles of Sir Isaac Newton and other mathematicians. Surveyor Furzer agreed that the method was good and recommended him to the Board for encouragement, ... In 1710 he made a proposal regarding the planking of ships' bottoms... In 1712 he made proposals for the more efficient use of hand pumps... In his leisure time over the past 30 years he has studied the works of mathematicians and Master Builders and has developed proposals for an entirely new way of building and equipping ships...<sup id=\"fnr19-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn19-id-2012-07-18\">19</a></sup>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He died in 1740.</p>\n<p><strong>Owen Sutherland</strong> is named in both William and Elizabeth Bagwell's wills as above. He was the younger brother of William and supplied timber from the New Forest to Portsmouth shipyard<sup id=\"fnr20-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn20-id-2012-07-18\">20</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jos(eph) Allin</strong> a witness to William's will. In 1694 he was 2nd assistant Master Shipwright at Portsmouth, then Deptford (1701), <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/\">Sheerness</a> (1704) &amp; <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/\">Woolwich</a> back to Deptford in 1705 as Master Shipwright. In 1708 he had the Master Shipwrights House built there which still survives. He was dismissed from service in 1715 on corruption charges. Commended in the parish records of 1710 for having \"raised the sum of fifty pounds and upwards\" towards the founding of a model school (which was apparently spurned by the shipbuilding community)<sup id=\"fnr21-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn21-id-2012-07-18\">21</a></sup>;  he died in 1716.</p>\n<p>His son, also Joseph, became Master Shipwright, Portsmouth in 1726, went on to become <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/486/\">Surveyor of the Navy</a> and was knighted in 1747. Subsequently his mental health collapsed leading to a commission and inquiry of lunacy in 1758<sup id=\"fnr22-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn22-id-2012-07-18\">22</a></sup>. He died the following year.   </p>\n<p>Finally, a fantasy reasoning:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Had his wife not engaged with Samuel Pepys then William Bagwell would not have risen to Master Shipwright.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Had William not have become a Master Shipwright then he would not have inspired his nephew William Sutherland to write his work on shipbuilding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Had William Sutherland not written his work then shipbuilding techniques would not have been of a quality to enhance us militarily up to and beyond the Napoleonic Wars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Had we not ruled the waves then the British Empire would not have come about.    </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should an overdue epitaph for Elizabeth Bagwell be \"Mother of the Navy\" perhaps? (With apologies to Arthur Bryant.)</p>\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Other suggested candidates for Mrs Bagwell</h2>\n<p><strong>Anne.</strong> Richard Endsor's book -- <cite>The Restoration Warship</cite> -- advances the case that Mrs Bagwell was named Anne and cites some pay <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/\">ticket</a> dispute papers in which she's named. Her court petition<sup id=\"fnr23-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn23-id-2012-07-18\">23</a></sup>  of 16 May 1681 reads \"Anne Bagwell widow ... to John Bagwell Shipwright\" -- not William -- and in a subsequent letter she's described as \"Anne Bagwell alias Bayley wife of William Bayley\" which leads back to the 1678 marriage referred to above. John Bagwell is not dead as we know although why he apparently became estranged from Anne and possibly his original family is unknown. Clearly however Anne was never William Bagwell's wife.   </p>\n<p><strong>Judith.</strong> A mooted but unlikely candidate is the Judeath (sic) Campion, cited in Richard Ollard's Pepys' biography, who marries a Will (sic) Bagwell at St Botolph's Bishopsgate in June 1660. In 1670 however a Judith (sic) Bagwell, widow of William, is contesting ownership of her late husband's estate in Lincolnshire<sup id=\"fnr24-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"#fn24-id-2012-07-18\">24</a></sup>. Given the relative rarity of the names -- Judith and Bagwell -- it seems reasonable to assume that these are the same people who married in London ten years earlier and that this deceased William is not our eponymous carpenter and shipwright.</p>\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr1-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn2-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/321/11, 15, 17, 19&amp;c. <a href=\"#fnr2-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn3-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/378 f424 <a href=\"#fnr3-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn4-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives, Navy Board records: ADM 106/493/50, 53, 55&amp;c. <a href=\"#fnr4-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn5-id-2012-07-18\">Google Books: <cite>A New List of all the ships and vessels of Her Majesties Royal Navy</cite> (1710) <a href=\"#fnr5-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn6-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 23 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr6-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn7-id-2012-07-18\">Unpublished counts of parish register entries and hearth tax returns by the author <a href=\"#fnr7-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn8-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 13 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr8-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn9-id-2012-07-18\"><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/23/\">Pepys' Diary 13 June 1666</a> <a href=\"#fnr9-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn10-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr10-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn11-id-2012-07-18\">Deptford Hearth Tax return of 1670 (currently in compilation at Greenwich Heritage centre) <a href=\"#fnr11-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn12-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/466 <a href=\"#fnr12-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn13-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/443 <a href=\"#fnr13-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn14-id-2012-07-18\">National Archives: PROB 11/443 <a href=\"#fnr14-id-2012-07-18\">&#8617;</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn15-id-2012-07-18\">Two other children -- Owen 1646 (a twin to John) and Owine 1658 -- died in infancy, a third, Alice 1651 marries in 1677 but no trace after that.

And so I betake myself to that course which is almost as much as to see myself go into my grave -- for which, and all the discomforts that will accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me.\n\nThe \"good God\" had other plans for Pepys, and although Sam closed the Diary, God gave him another 34 years of life full of accomplishments, well earned promotions, political perils, and an assortment of interestingly diverse characters. Sam would find himself surviving the reigns of [Charles II](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/), [James II](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/) and William III and would see James's daughter Anne find her way to the throne. Along the way he would continue to excel in his naval accomplishments, assorted MP positions, his role in the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at [Christ's Hospital](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2984/), his Fellowship and role as President of the [Royal Society](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4134/), among the highlights. He would welcome new friends and bid sad farewells to many of those we came to know so well in his Diary. But, as the Diary ended, all of those things were in the future and Sam was more concerned with his immediate plans, his desire to share some pleasurable time with his wife [Elizabeth](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/).\n\n## I. Elizabeth\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_Pepys.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/ElizabethPepys_1666.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Elizabeth Pepys, 1666\" width=\"368\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_Pepys.jpg\">Portrait of Elizabeth Pepys. An 1825 engraving of a painting by John Hayls, 1666</a></p>\n\nShortly after the Diary ended, Elizabeth and Sam traveled together to Paris with her brother [Balty](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/). In preparation for that trip Sam and his friend [John Evelyn](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/) exchanged letters regarding Sam's upcoming travels. In his letter to Sam dated 21 August 1669, John shared with Sam pages of wonderful \"must see\" locations and letters of introduction. A small excerpt is below and the full letter [is located here](http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1669/08/21/evelyn-to-pepys/)\n(de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Particular Friends</cite>, p.68):\n\n> Pray forget not to visit the Taille-Douce shops, and make Collection of what they have excellent, especially the Draughts of their Palaces, Churches, and Gardens, and the particulars you will have seen; they will greatly refresh you in your Study, and by the fire side, when you are many years return'd. Israel, Sylvestre, Morin, Chaveau, are great Masters, both for things of the kind extant, and Inventions extreamly pleasant. You will easily be acquainted with the best Painters, especially LeBrun, who is chief of them; and it would not be amiss to be present at their Acadamie, in which Monsieur du Bosse (a principal member) will conduct you. For the rest, I recommend you to God's Almighty Protection; augure you in a happy journey, and kissing you Lady's Hands remain,\n> \n> Sir, Your most humble and obedient Servant J. Evelyn\n\nWithout Sam's meticulous Diary, there is little known about their actual adventures, but as Diary enthusiasts can imagine, any adventure that included Balty must have been filled with tall tales, merriment and perhaps a few headaches for Sam.  What is sadly known is that on the way home, while traveling through [Flanders](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/), Elizabeth became very ill with a fever. They arrived [home](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/) in late October, as Elizabeth struggled with her illness. The severity of her situation obviously derailed the etiquette-aware Sam, as it was not until November 2, 1669 that Sam penned an apologetic letter to John Evelyn. In it he begged for forgiveness for not thanking him promptly and expressed his distress at Elizabeth's dire situation. [This letter](http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1669/11/02/pepys-to-evelyn/) to a close and personal friend captures the severity of Elizabeth's illness and shows the emotional impact on Sam as he faced fears of her death (de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Particular Friends</cite>, p.76):\n\n> SIR. I beg you to believe that I would not have been ten days returned into England without waiting on you, had it not pleased God to afflict mee by the sickness of my wife, who, from the first day of her coming back to London, hath layn under a fever so severe as at this hour to render her recoverie desperate; which affliction hath very much unfitted me for those acts of civilities and respect which, amongst the first of my friends, I should have paid to yourselfe, as he to whom singly I owe the much greater part of the satisfaction I have met with in my late voyage. Next to you, I have my acknowledgements to make to Sir Samuel Tuke, to whom (when in a condition of doing it) I shall beg your introducing me, for the owning of my obligations to him on the like behalfe. But, Sir, I beg you heartily to dispense with the ceremonie, till I am better qualified for paying it; and in the meane time receive the enclosed, which I should with much more satisfaction have delivered with my owne hand. \n> \n> I am, Sir Your most obliged and obedient Servant. S. Pepys\n> \n> I most humbly kiss you ladies hands, and pray my service may be presented to Sir Richard Browne [John Evelyn's Father-in-law, the diplomatist]\n\nAs Elizabeth neared death, Sam made arrangements for [Milles](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1215/), the Rector of [St Olave's](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/), to offer her a final sacrament. Although Elizabeth had professed her leanings towards [Catholicism](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/306/) in the past (usually when angered by Sam), she received the Holy Sacrament according to the rites of the [Church of England](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7542/). She passed away shortly thereafter on November 10, 1669. The man who offered us so much of his personal insights in the Diary remains sadly silent to us during such a devastating loss.  Perhaps he chose to leave behind only his memories of her life and not her death. Ardent followers of the Diary no doubt can feel his pain as we remember their story in the pages of Sam's Diary. His entries, often filled with their arguments and jealousies, were also full of his loving reflections on Elizabeth's beauty and her dedication to him. After their difficulties of late over Sam's relationship with [Deb Willet](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11640/), Sam and Elizabeth seemed to be moving towards a closer relationship.  Sam's 'poor wretch' was gone and the void she left was never filled.\n\nSam commissioned a monument of Elizabeth as \"immortalised\" at St. Olave's (below) which captured her beauty and spirit. It was set at St. Olave's to face the Navy pew, where it remains today. Although we don't have the Diary to express Sam's loss, we do have the Latin epitaph that Sam wrote as a farewell to his beloved wife. \n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104352364/\" title=\"ElizabethPepys2 by Graham_T, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/36/104352364_0cd90438f6.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"ElizabethPepys2\"></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104352364/in/pool-73104548@N00/\">Photo by Graham Travis at Flickr</a></p>\n\nA [group translation by our annotators](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/#summary) of her epitaph  reads: \n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"center\">HERE LIES<br />\nELIZABETH PEPYS<br />\nTo Whom<br />\nSomerset gave her cradle, Octob: 23, 1640,</p>\n\n<table style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:1em;line-height:1.3em;\"><tr><td style=\"width:50%\">Andegavia gave<br />  \nHer Father of the glori-<br />  \nous house of St. Michel,  </td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Cumbria gave<br /> \nHer Mother of the noble<br />  \nstock of the Cliffords,</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>Wife of Samuel Pepys (who serves the Royal Navy)<br />\nShe was educated first in a convent, and then in a seminary of France.<br />\nShe was distinguished by the excellence of both at once;<br />\nGifted with beauty, accomplishments, tongues;<br />\nShe bore no offspring, for she could not have borne her like.<br />\nAt length, when she had bidden the world a gentle farewell,<br />\n(After a journey completed through, we may say, the lovelier sights of Europe)-<br />\nA returning pilgrim, she took her departure to wander through a grander world. </p>\n \n<p>She died the 10th of November In the 29th year of her age,<br />\nIn the 15th year of her marriage,<br />\nIn the year of our Lord 1669.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\nA selection from a belated letter which Sam sent to Captain Elliot dated 3 March 1670, to thank him for supporting him in his unsuccessful election contest some 4 months later follows. It gives an indication of the extent of the ongoing emotional impact of Sam's loss (de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Letters of Samuel Pepys</cite>, p.84).\n\n> CAPTAIN ELLIOT, I beg you earnestly to believe that nothing but the sorrow and distraction I have been in by the death of my wife, increased by the suddenness with which it pleased God to surprise me with therewith, after a voyage so full of health and content, could have forced me to so long a neglect of my private concernments; this being, I do assure you, the very first day that my affliction, together with my daily attendance on other public occasions of his Majesty's, has suffered me to apply myself to the considering any part of my private concernments; among which, that of my doing right to you is no small particular: and therefore, as your charity will, I hope, excuse me for my not doing it sooner, so I pray you to accept now, as late as it is, my hearty thanks for your multiplied kindness in my late affair at [Aldborough](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8279/)...\n\nSam continued to support Elizabeth's parents [Alexandre](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/) and [Dorothea St. Michel](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/), her brother Balty and his family throughout his life.  His unwavering devotion and loyalty to her memory is reflected in his generosity to her family. \n\nCoinciding with her illness and subsequent death, Sam found himself being pulled into the defense of the [Navy Office](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/) against the [Brooke House Commission's](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12029/) accusations of corruption and inefficiency. After he buried Elizabeth at St. Olave's, he set out to successfully repudiate the claims against the Navy as well as those levied against him directly (accepting illegal fees). The Brooke House sittings went on for two months, as Sam awaited his fate.\n\n> Of his fellow officials at the Navy Board during the war, [Batten](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/) was dead and [Penn](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/) close to death -- he died in September 1670. [Coventry](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/) and [Carteret](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/) had left the board in 1667, Pett had been pushed out, and [Sir John Mennes](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/) was not held responsible for anything -- he died February 1671. Only [Brouncker](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/) and Pepys remained of the old guard to take the blame. Neither lost his job. (Tomalin, p.281)\n\nLife in Sam's personal circle moved on, as his sister [Pall](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/) (married to [John Jackson](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11931/)) delivered a son, whom she named Samuel. In 1670 Sam helped secure Balty a permanent position as a Muster-Master at [Deal](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/641/) and helped his brother [John](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/) to be appointed as Clerk to Trinity House (the seaman's foundation). Shortly thereafter Sam was admitted as an Elder Brother at [Trinity House](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10531/) and in 1676 become a Master.  Sam once again began to enjoy the friendships he had with John Evelyn, [Anthony Deane](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/), and the Houblon family, who were merchants in the shipping and trade business, becoming closest to [James](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/) (who would prove a true friend to the end).  Around this time, Sam took in a housekeeper, Mary Skinner and the relationship developed into an affair. Sam would never marry her, but she would remain his faithful mistress, until his death.  Of course, without his Diary, it's hard to know how 'faithful' Sam was to her.\n\n\n## II. Lord Sandwich and the Third Dutch War \n\nWith the death of his beloved daughter [Paulina](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2848/) in February 1669, [Lord Sandwich](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/) left London and returned to [Hinchingbrooke](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/) where he spent two months grieving among his family. To paraphrase Ollard (<cite>Cromwell's Earl</cite>, p.248), since Sandwich's return from abroad his eldest son and heir [Ned](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/670/) had married the loveable daughter of [Lady Burlington](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11131/), bringing great joy to the family. There were four boys of school age or younger. Of the daughters, the family was pleased when [Anne](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/171/) married Sir Richard Edgecumbe in January 1671.  During that month [Sydney](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1507/), Sandwich's favorite son, retuned from his grand European tour. After Sandwich's death Sydney would marry the great heiress Anne Wortley. Of the marriage between [Philip Carteret](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8250/) and [Jemimah](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/), which Sam helped orchestrate and so well recorded, there were three grandchildren added to the family: \"George was born in 1667, Philip in 1669 and Edward in 1671. The birth of this last child cost Jemimah her life. She was buried at Hawnes Church on 21st November, and her baby was christened a week later.\" (Balleine,  p.162).\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lely,_Edward_Montagu.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/EdwardMontagu_1666.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Edward Montagu, 1666\" width=\"408\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lely,_Edward_Montagu.jpg\">Portrait of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, by Sir Peter Lely, 1666</a></p>\n\nThe Third Dutch War began in 1672, and Sandwich was called upon to command the flagship the *[Royal James](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3124/)*.  During the battle at [Sole Bay](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8608/) on May 28th Sandwich\n\n> had been wounded slightly in the arm and thigh. His companions urged him to jump and swim for it but his bulk and general unwieldiness disinclined him. Perhaps the constricting formality of his clothes he had put on, the caparison of a commander leading his men into battle, further inhibited him. When his body was found in the water thirty miles away near a fortnight later he was still wearing his [Garter](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/859/) ribbon. He had still been on board when everyone else who could stand had left the ship but the corpse showed no sign of scorching or singeing. The recognition that had been denied him in life was granted in death. [The King] gave orders that he should be buried at [Westminster Abbey](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/) with the magnificence of a great public occasion.\" (Ollard, <cite>Cromwell's Earl</cite>, p.262).\n \nJohn Evelyn, upon the loss of his esteemed friend, recorded his thoughts in his Diary entry of May 31, 1772:\n\n> My L: Sandwich was prudent as well as Valiant, &amp; allways govern'd his affairs with successe, and little losse, he was for deliberation &amp; reason... Thus this gallant Person perish'd ... &amp; deplorable was the losse, of one of the best accomplish[ed] persons, not onely of this Nation but of any other: He was learned in Mathematics, in Musique, in Sea affaires, in Political: Had ben divers Embassies, was of a sweet obliging temper, Sober, Chast, infinitly ingenious &amp; a true noble man, an ornament to the Court &amp; his Prince, nor has he left any that approach his many Virtues behind him ... I am yet heartily griev'd at this mightly losse, nor do I call it to my thoughts without emotion.\n\nAlthough the friendship between Lord Sandwich and Sam had cooled over the years, perhaps due to a combination of Sam's independent rising in stature and lingering resentment of Sam's [\"great letter of reproof\"](http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/18/), Sam walked as a banner-bearer in the funeral processions, but Lord Sandwich did not mention him in his will. \n\nAnother loss of life aboard the *Royal James*, was Sandwich's son-in-law Philip Carteret (husband of the late Jemimah) who was Sandwich's Lieutenant on the ship. Upon his death, the three children of the Carteret-Sandwich union were now orphaned. [Sir George Carteret](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/) and [Lady Carteret](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/) moved to Hawes (Philip's residence) and lived there with their grandchildren for the rest of their lives.  Lady Sandwich left Hinchingbrooke, her home of thirty years, and went to live with her daughter Anne, where she died two years later.  \n\n\n## III. Secretary of the \"New\" Admiralty\n\n1672 brought the death of Elizabeth's father, Alexandre St Michel and Sam's [Uncle Wight](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/). Shortly thereafter [Mary Mercer](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/), Elizabeth's Diary companion was gone. A loss of a different nature was brought about by the fire at the Navy offices in early 1673. Sam's house was burnt to the ground, but somehow he saved the six volumes of his Diary, if little else. The home he enjoyed for so many years of the Diary, where he rose in his career, built up his proud possessions, shared times with friends, and which held memories of his wife, was now gone. \n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_diary_manuscript_volumes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/DiaryVolumes.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" alt=\"Diary Volumes\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_diary_manuscript_volumes.jpg\">Bound volumes of Samuel Pepys' diary</a></p>\n\nThe year did bring some good news as Pall gave birth to her son John Jackson. Sam became involved in the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, and was soon after appointed Governor of the hospital. After the fire, the Navy moved him to Winchester Street. With the introduction of the Test Act, which excluded Catholics from office, James II was forced to resign as the Lord High Admiral of the Navy. The King replaced the Duke's position with a group of Admiralty Commissioners. Pepys was appointed Secretary of the Admiralty and in 1674 moved to the Admiralty Office at Derby House. His old position as [Clerk of the Acts](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/484/) was split between his brother John and [Tom Hayter](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/). Pepys asserted his role and used his exceptional public speaking abilities to present an account of the navy and to secure the \u00a3600,000 needed for thirty new ships. His major accomplishment was his proposal that \n\n> no one should be appointed as lieutenant until he had served for three years, received a certificate from his captain and passed an examination in navigation and seamanship at the Navy Office... Pepys had made history at a stroke, bringing about a revolution in the way the navy was run, fired by his belief that education and intelligence were more useful to the nation than family background and money; and that however courageous 'gentlemen' captains might be, the service needed to be professionalized. (Tomalin, p.297).\n\nThe King apparently agreed with Sam's thoughts on the necessity of education in naval affairs and also granted his later request of funds for a mathematical endowment for Christ's Hospital School where boys could be properly prepared for the navy. \n\nSam's accomplishments and positions increased as he was elected MP for Castle Rising, Norfolk, appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital, elected a Master of Trinity House and soon after elected a Master of the Clothworkers Company. Amidst all of this good news, Sam was to suffer unexpected sadness at the loss of his brother John, who died in the spring of 1677. Shortly thereafter, Sam's old amour of the Diary, Deb Willet, who had married and remained in London, died. There is correspondence to show that while she was alive, Sam assisted her husband, a theology graduate, to obtain a position as a ship's chaplain. It is not known if Sam continued any type of sexual or other relationship with Deb, but it seems quite plausible. \n\n\n## IV. Perils of the Popish Plots\n\nThe changing political scene and the rise of anti-Catholic activities began to turn against Sam. Throughout Charles II's reign, a political plot worked against James, the Duke of York and a number of other Papists in high places (including [Queen Catherine](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/)). The plots were intended to discredit Catholics who were close to the King, with the hope to gain control of the succession of the Crown. \n\nIn 1678, these clandestine plans would prove \"personal\" (Heath, p.xiii) and involve Sam, with the hopes to reflect poorly upon his patron, James, the Duke of York. This activity was part of the overall Popish Plots. During this time, the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a well known [Protestant](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7980/) magistrate, opened a huge opportunity for the conspirators to blame the Papists for his death. Helen Heath explains that the original plan may have been to implicate Sam in the murder of Godfrey. Luckily, Sam was away at the time of the murder so the conspirators went after his clerk, Samuel Atkins. The evidence proved so false that the boy was released.\n\nAs the political players shifted, Sam was no longer wanted as MP at Castle Rising, but was elected along with Anthony Deane as MP at [Harwich](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/) (Tomalin, p.311). The Admiralty Commission was dissolved and a new one appointed with people who were not favorably disposed towards Sam. In a political move, the King sent his brother the Duke of York abroad, which did not bode well for Sam, who was to become the next target. \n\nHooligans, who were believed to have been bribed by those working on the behalf of Lord Shaftesbury, were pulled together to bring false charges against Sam and Deane which included providing information to the French (treason), piracy, and in Pepys' case, being a Catholic. Sam's accuser on the treason charges was Colonel John Scott. The piracy charge (more directed toward Deane) was brought by Captain Moore and the accusations of being a Catholic came from a former servant of Sam's, John James. As Sam was sent to [the Tower](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/), he resigned as the Secretary of the Admiralty and the [Treasurer of Tangier](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/).\n\nAs a response to the accusations of Catholicism, [Balty penned a letter](http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1673/02/08/st-michel-to-pepys/), with the intent of \"proving\" that the charges of Popery in Sam's home were false and misleading. Although the readers of the Diary will all know that Elizabeth had a leaning towards Catholicism, the letter provided Sam with an endorsement and allows readers  to hear the incredibly melodramatic \"voice\" of Balty at his best.  \n\nSam, who has been a faithful servant to King Charles, was left without any public support from the King he served so well. Charles, who was solely interested in maintaining the throne, had to let the proceedings carry out without intervention. Charles only intervened with an uncharacteristic and vehement support when his neglected Queen Catherine was falsely accused of involvement in an attempted murder plot against him. Charles publicly defended her and as her letters reveal (Davidson, p.456) Charles went so far as to secure a secret getaway to France if it appeared that the opposing forces would try to imprison her. \n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Titus_Oates1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/PopishPlots.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" alt=\"Popish Plots\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Titus_Oates1.jpg\">Titus Oates accused James I's secretary, Edward Coleman, of being involved in the Popish Plot. This picture of Coleman appeared on the songsheet, <cite>The Plotter Executed</cite> (1678)</a></p>\n\nFor Sam, now in prison, there was no such royal support and a desperate need to clear his name. From behind the Tower walls, Sam realised he needed to manage his own defence. From his cell, Sam was left to rely on his network of friends, professional and political contacts (many of whom had to work undercover so as not to be associated with an accused traitor), and someone who could infiltrate the world of the slippery Colonel Scott. There was a need for \"spy\" work to be done in France in order to discredit and prove his accuser, Colonel Scott a liar. To his credit, and, most likely to the amazement of many Diary readers, Balty rose magnificently to the occasion and herein proved his greatest service to Sam. In spite of all his flaws and failures he went to France to pursue  \"a sort of double life between the wealthy merchants of Pepys' acquaintance, on the one hand, and the rogues and vagabonds who consorted  with the nefarious Colonel Scott on the other\" (Heath, p.xxv).  Balty enjoyed an 'all expenses paid' vacation and Sam had his French spy, looking for credible enemies of Scott (there were plenty) who would come forth to speak out and discredit him.\n\nAs 1679 progressed, Sam's friends, among them James Houblon, put up bail. Sam left the Tower and went to live with [Will Hewer](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/), who was already providing housing for Balty's [wife](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/) and children while Balty was in France. As evidence against John Scott began to pile up, he went abroad. John James, who was ill and perhaps wanted to die with a clear conscience, gave a statement that he had been paid to bring false statements against Sam. Without any concrete evidence against him, by June of the next year all proceedings against Sam were finally dropped. \n\n<iframe width=\"460\" height=\"264\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nzm1FsqXj7M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzm1FsqXj7M\">A video of where Pepys lived from 1679-1688, and the York Stairs water gate where he would have gone down to the River Thames. By Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re</a></p>\n\nSam's moment of relief was not long enjoyed, as his brother-in-law John Jackson and then [his father](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/) died by the end of the year, leaving Sam estates to settle, a house to care for and a widowed sister with two sons who would no doubt need his oversight. Sam found schooling for Pall's sons, he secured a position for Balty in [Tangier](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/) and set his wife Esther and children to live in [Brampton](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4914/). Sam remained in London, living with his friend Will Hewer, who by now had amassed significant money from his dealing in trade. Hewer, whose fortunes would grow substantially over the years, continued to graciously welcome Sam and his circle into his homes.\n\nIn 1681, upon the death of her husband [Tom Edwards](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/), Sam's beloved [Jane](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/) returned to his service in order to support her two children. Sam took good care to get her eldest son and his godson (also named Samuel) a place in Christ's Church to study mathematics. Jane married but was soon widowed again. As a statement of his devotion to his old friend, in 1690 Sam \"settled an annuity of \u00a315 a year on her\" (Tomalin, p.244).\n\nNow, Sam found himself unemployed. He spent the next years rather out of the public eye, but did attend the King and Duke of York in [Newcastle](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7005/), where he recorded the King's great escape from the Battle of Worcester. He also attended the Duke of York on several occasions. \n\n\n## V.  Return to Public Service\n\nIn 1683 the King sent Sam on an undisclosed trip accompanying Lord Dartmouth. Sam was able to take Will Hewer and they departed, only later to find that the secret purpose was to evacuate Tangier and destroy everything that remained behind. As that operation progressed Sam and Will took a side trip to Spain, which was miserable weather wise, but which added some rarities for his library. Sam received his first pay in years and was given \u00a31000. More important he was given an entr\u00e9e back into the navy. In 1684 the King determined that he would take the role Lord High Admiral and would be assisted by the Duke of York. In June Sam was given a new position created for him by the King as the Secretary of the Affairs of the Admiralty. \n\nThat year, Sam, who had been a member of the Royal Society since 1665, was elected as President, a role that he maintained for two years. Although not a scientist by nature, Sam's administrative talents were a welcome contribution. The Royal Society was an excellent place for Sam to indulge his curiosity, enjoy interesting conversations and mix with such prominent scientists of the day such as Sir Issac Newton, [Robert Boyle](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8282/), [Robert Hooke](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8179/) and [Christopher Wren](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9711/)). During his presidency, Newton's <cite>Principia Mathematica</cite> was published and its title page included Pepys' name.\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prinicipia-title.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/Principia-title.png\" width=\"233\" height=\"327\" alt=\"Principia Mathematica title page\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prinicipia-title.png\"><cite>Principia Mathematica</cite> title page</a></p>\n\nKing Charles II died in 1685 and was succeeded by his brother James. Sam attended the Duke of York's coronation as King James II as a Baron of the [Cinque Ports](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/614/). Sam maintained his Secretary position for James II. He was reelected MP for Harwich and appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Huntingdonshire. By July he was appointed a Master at Trinity House for a second time (Ollard's Chronology from <cite>Pepys</cite>, p.378).\n\nIn January 1686, Sam presented James II with a review of the navy which criticised those who had run it in his absence. He requested and was granted a \"Special Commission\" to make well managed and necessary ship repairs. The Commission would sit for three years. Sam drafted the terms of the Commission and handpicked its Commissioners who included those he knew he could rely on (Anthony Deane, Will Hewer and rather surprisingly Balty). The Special Commission first sat in March 1686. John Ehrman's quote (Ollard, <cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p.311) details the rebuilding of the fleet:\n\n> The outstanding work of the Commission, however, lay in its programme of repair. Its success rested upon three distinct achievements. First, the repairs were fully and efficiently carried out; secondly, they did not exceed the original estimate of their cost; and thirdly, they were completed in less than the original estimate of time required. All of these facts were later questioned, but all were finally established by the Parliament inquiry of 1691-2, in its election of a defence of their work from Deane and Hewer, the two men principally concerned, and in the detailed acknowledgement of its validity by the Parliamentary Commissioners themselves. \n> \n> Altogether the Special Commission repaired 69 ships and rebuilt twenty. It also built the three fourth-rates promised, and a [hoy](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2705/) and two [lighters](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/). By the time it came to a close, only four ships remained and their repairs not completed, and four more with their repairs not begun. In addition to the work on these 96 ships, a further 29 were repaired which had been at sea when the Commission was inaugurated, and had not been included in the original programme. Pepys's intentions were therefore more than fulfilled in the number of vessels which were tackled.\n \nMeanwhile, Tomalin (p.337-8) offers a wonderful account of the status of Sam's personal circle during this time, as paraphrased here. Sam succeeded in getting Balty installed in the former Treasurer's House in [Deptford](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/). \"This was the high point of Balty's career, and at the end of 1686 Pepys urged him to take responsibility for his own future, warning him that he himself had lost strength and was suffering from a new [kidney stone](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/346/) and ulcer.\"\n\nAt this point, his wife Esther who was pregnant with their seventh child, died in childbirth. Balty had neither the skills not inclination to manage his financial future and would continue to rely on Sam. Sam's sister Pall remained in Brampton and of her two sons, Samuel, who was a less than a stellar learner, was sent to sea at age fifteen. The younger son John Jackson, who showed promise, was entered a pensioner at [Magdalene](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/419/). From all indications, John was aware that he needed to work hard and was capable of doing so.\n\nOf his 'extended family', Sam saw Jane [Birch] Edward's son \"presented to the king and the lord mayor along with other boys of the mathematics department\". Of the next generation of children (Balty's and Pall's), John Jackson was emerging in Sam's eyes as the most promising.\n\nOn a sad note, the year brought the loss of two old friends, first Sam's respected and dignified friend William Coventry and later, a friend of an altogether totally different ilk, the 'pleasurable' [Betty Martin](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/).\n\nThe Special Commission was dissolved ahead of schedule in October of 1688, due to its considerable success. Although Sam had intended these upgrades in support of James II, in November [William of Orange](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/) landed in Torbay and by December James II had fled.  As can be expected William's reign brought a quick purge of those loyal to James II. Sam lost his MP role for Harwich and resigned as Secretary of the Admiralty and from his Trinity House position. Deane and Hewer also resigned their naval positions, while Balty was dismissed.\n\nBalty married Margaret Darling, a widow with two children of her own.He now had 9-10 (sources vary) children to provide for and had no job, savings, or pension. On Balty's behalf, Sam wrote several letters, which led to the King's letter to the Commissioner of the Navy, requesting that they examine the case of Balty's service and find employment for him.  This request was unsuccessful. During this time, there appears to have been a falling out between Sam and Balty, for which most biographers conjecture was due to an argument over the position of Sam's housekeeper, Mary Skinner. This letter from Balty to Sam perhaps caused or further widened the breach between them. (Heath, p.223-4):\n\n> Deptford, May 28, 1689\n> \n> Honoured Sir:\n> \n> After my late haveing groaned under Sume trubles (on my private Account) which at this unfortunate juncture of time have prooved extreame heavy and Grivious to me; I understand that by the malicious inventive ill Offices of a female Beast, which you keepe, I am like allsoe to lye under your Anger and disgrace (to me more insuportable than the former) but I hope, and humble pray, (though she tould me impudently, and arogantly, you Scorned to see me) that with your Generous Usuall goodness, wisdome, manhood, and former kindness you will not damn him Unheard who Shoulde Joy to hazard (as in duty bound) his dearest Bludd for your Service. The meane while, returning your honour my most humble and harty thanks for the Petition you sent me, and for all other your many favours I remaine\n>\n> Your Ever Dutifull and most faithfull humble Servant  &nbsp; &nbsp;   B ST MICHEL\n\nFrom this time on Balty was not welcome. Recorded letters to date seem to indicate that Sam stopped writing to Balty. From Balty's letters he was soon reduced to begging: \"if you have any Spare Cast-off Morning Gowne, Peruiques, and Some like Cast off large Cloake-Coate, which things you could Spare without the least inconveniency to you, if you woold Spare them to your Afflicted Servant they woold be very welcome and with Milions of thanks...\" (Heath, p.229). Although it's not clear what allowances  Sam may have made for Balty over the continuing years, what is known is that  Sam continued (although unsuccessfully) to write letters on Balty's behalf with the intent to have his old age officially provided for.\n   \nSam had two short imprisonments during the French invasion scares of 1689 and 1690. In November of 1689, Pall died and was buried at Brampton. Sam \"had a memorial stone  put up in the aisle of Brampton Church -- it can still be seen there\" (Tomalin, p.347). Sam also let out Brampton.  In December of 1690 Sam published his Memoirs of the Royal Navy 1679-88.\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/SamuelPepys_1689.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Samuel Pepys, 1689\" width=\"412\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\">Portrait of Samuel Pepys by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689</a></p>\n\n\n## VI. Sam's Last Chapter\n\nWith retirement, Sam turned his focus to the things he truly treasured: wonderful conversations with friends, collecting his notes for a (never published) History of the Navy and working on his beloved library. Pall's youngest son, John Jackson, whom Sam had a sincere affection for, had finished his time at Magdalene college and now moved into Sam's home in the York Buildings to be his personal clerk, copying manuscripts and assisting with the library. There is an indication that the relationship between John and Mary Skinner was not always smooth (perhaps mistrust between them), so one can assume that retirement did not bring Sam total household peace.\n\nIn September of 1693, Sam had an unsettling experience while on the way to [Chelsea](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2610/). Sam, his lady friends and John, were robbed by two masked men. Although they were quite frightened, they were not harmed. Two of the robbers were caught, tried and hanged.\n\nBy 1694, Sam saw John elected to the Royal Society. Pall's oldest son, Samuel, had returned from his ship duties and managed the Brampton estate. Coinciding with these events, Sam began to face several periods of illness and traveled back and forth to the country (Will Clapham's estate) where he would find rest and recovery.  Will, Sam's devoted lifelong friend, always made sure he was warmly welcomed and cared for. Will kept actively involved in his trade business, becoming Director of the old [East India Company](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2494/) from 1698-1703. \n\nSam continued to correspond and enjoy the company of friends as he was able. He put his energies into planning John's \"Grand Tour\" of Europe. The intent of a young man's tour of this type was to broaden their education and provide introductions to prominent people. In the case of this trip, John was also given the task of collecting books for Sam's growing library, which would eventually include more than three thousand volumes. Sam's friend James Houblon was instrumental at providing itineraries, guides, and introductions for John's adventures.\n\nJohn departed in 1699. Sam, whose fondness for John had grown, missed him dearly. While Sam filled his time having a desk and bookcase built for his library, the two corresponded frequently. Sam, who may have been reminiscing of the past, sent a rather touching note to John in regards to the Dowager Queen Catherine of Braganza. In 1700, while John was in Portugal, Sam asked him to \"wait on Lady Tuke, and if the honour of kissing the hand of the Queen-Dowager were offered him, to be sure to present to that royal lady, whom he [Sam] held in great honour, his profoundest duty.\" (Davidson, p.481).\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_John_Closterman.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/SamuelPepys_1690s.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Samuel Pepys, 1690s\" width=\"398\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_John_Closterman.jpg\">Portrait of Samuel Pepys by John Closterman, 1690s</a></p>\n\nSam's dear friend James Houblon, whose wife [Sarah](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8397/) had recently died, sadly joined her. Of this significant loss, Sam wrote \"one of the longest and well as most approved friends till now left me in the world\" (Tomalin, p.362). In 1701, there was another loss, for which Sam may have had a private smile, knowing he outlived his rival of the Diary, [John Creed](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/).  \n\nIn June of 1701, Sam, who had spent his retirement traveling back and forth between London and Clapham, permanently moved to Clapham. Sam was very ill and wrote to John requesting his return. John arrived back in August and was put in charge of Sam's library.\n\nIn August 1701, Sam wrote his will, leaving Hewer as executor and providing him \u00a3500. He noted his annuity to Jane and left Brampton to his nephew Samuel. Shortly thereafter, Sam angrily discovered that Samuel had married without his consult or consent, a choice that would later cost him dearly. \n\nIn 1702 the massive task of relocating Sam's library to Clapham was successfully completed.  Sam was now surrounded by the people he most loved; John, Mary and Will, along with the collection he cherished. He would live out his remaining days with his Diary close by.\n\nSam outlived William III, and Queen Anne was crowned. By 1703, it appeared that Sam knew he was not long for this world. He turned his attentions to take care of those he loved and those he still felt an obligation towards. The last letter Sam wrote was to Sir George Rooke, Commander in Chief of the Fleete, where he made a last plea for a pension for Balty. It is not known if the two ever reconciled or if Balty visited Sam in his last days.\n\nAs he was nearing the end, Sam made dramatic changes to his will with two major codicils. The first codicil took away Brampton from Samuel and gave it to John. Sam then settled on a \u00a340 annuity a year for Samuel. The major part of Sam's estate went to John. Sam's library was put into Trust and John and Will Hewer would have joint responsibility for it. Upon John's death, the library was to be left for posterity. The collection was to remain intact and go to a university, preferably the library of Magdalene, with the stipulation that the \n\n> collection must be kept entire and separate, in a room to be chosen by Jackson in the new building, no one allowed to remove any books except the master, and he only as far as to his lodge. [Sam] proposed a system of annual visitation by Trinity to check that his instructions were being obeyed in perpetuity, giving them the right to the library if they found any infringement by Magdalene\" (Tomalin, p.367).\n \nThe second codicil acknowledged his companion, Mary Skinner:\n\n> Whereas I hold myself obliged on this occasion to leave behind me the most full and lasting acknowledgement of my esteem respect and gratitude to the Excellent Lady Mrs. Mary Skyner for the many important Effects of her Steddy friendship and Assistances during the whole course of my life, within the last thirty three years; I doe give and devise unto the said Mrs. Mary Skyner One Annuity or yearly payment of Two hundred pounds of lawful money of England for and during the terms of her natural Life. (Tomalin, p.367-8)\n\nA smaller codicil provided \u00a350 of [plate](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/) for Mary, Will and John, and left pictures to Mary. Sam also had an estimated \u00a328,000 due to him from the Crown which was never to be paid, and therefore never dispersed per the directives he set forth. \n\nOn May 14th John Evelyn, Sam's last remaining friend of his intimate circle, now 82, visited Sam for the last time. John was recovering from a broken leg. This friendship, so wonderfully recorded in the letters between them through the years, remained solid until the end.\n\nAs death neared, Sam was constantly cared for by Will, Mary and John. On Monday, May 26th Dr. Hickes, who would also conduct Sam's funeral, arrived to give Sam his final sacraments. He later wrote to his friend Charlett (Ollard, <cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p.368): \n\n> The greatness of his behaviour, in his long and sharp tryall before his death, was in every respect answerable to his great life; and I believe no man ever went out of this world with greater contempt of it, or a more lively faith in every  thing that was revealed of the world to come. I administered the Holy Sacrament twice in his illness to him, and had administered it a third time, but for a sudden fit of illness that happened at the appointed time of administering of it. Twice I gave him the absolution of the Church, which he desired, and received with all reverence and comfort; and I never attended any sick or dying person that dyed with some much Christian greatnesse of mind, or a more lively sense of immortality, or so much fortitude and patience, in so long and sharp a tryall, or greater resignation to the will, which he most devoutly acknowledged to be the wisdom of God; and I doubt not but he is now a very blessed spirit, according to his motto, 'Mens cujusque is est quisque'.\n\nPerhaps there is no one better than John Evelyn to leave behind a touching eulogy for a life so fully lived. Evelyn's May 26, 1703 Diary entry on the death of his friend Samuel Pepys (Bastable, p.266):\n\n> May 26th. This day died Mr. Sam. Pepys, a very worthy, industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed thro' all the most considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty, all which he perform'd with great integrity. When K. James II went out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more, but withdrawing himselfe from all public affaires, he liv'd at Clapham with his partner Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and sweete place, where he enjoy'd the fruits of his labours in greate prosperity. He was universally belov'd, hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skill'd in music, a very greate cherisher of learned men of whom he had the conversation. His library and collection of other curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships especially. Beside what he publish'd of an account of the Navy, as he found and left it, he had for divers yeares under his hand the History of the Navy, or Navalia as he call'd it; but how far advanc'd, and what will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son Mr. Jackson, a young gentleman whom Mr. Pepys had educated in all sorts of usefull learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he return's with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir. Mr. Pepys had been for neere 40 years so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies, but in my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last office.\n\nSam's funeral took place on the evening of June 4th. Per Sam's directive he was to be buried alongside his wife, Elizabeth. Sam was\n\n> buried in front of the altar at St Olave's ... Elizabeth's bust looked down on a gathering of representatives of almost every stage and facet of her husband's career. Balty was there, supported by one of his daughters. The second Earl of Sandwich and his brother the Dean of Durham sat next to them. A host of Pepys's relations and connections echo the pages of the Diary. His doctors, his banker his book-binder, his lawyer: the Clapham household, the Hewer clan, the President and many of the Fellows of the Royal Society, the Dean of Christ's Church and the Master of Trinity, even the venerable Dr. Wallis swelled the crowd. The Board of the Admiralty were there in force and both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, though it was the non-juror Hickes who took the service. As in life, so at the commendation of his soul to God there was room for the people who had loved and served him as well as for the famous and the talented. (Ollard, <cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p.369).\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104325360/\" title=\"Pepys Plaque by Graham_T, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/43/104325360_e5244fcf73.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Pepys Plaque\"></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104325360/\">Photo by Graham Travis at Flickr</a></p>\n\n## VII. Final Farewells \n\nAfter Sam's death, John Jackson moved to the Hewer household and took formal responsibility for the library. Per Sam's request, he contacted and then visited Magdalene to select the rooms for the library. \"During 1705 the catalogue was completed, the last bookcases installed, and the whole of Pepys  collection, including his model shops, portraits and some of his furniture, put on display in Clapham\" (Tomalin, p.372).\n\nSam's friend John Evelyn outlived Sam by three years, spending his final years with his wife Mary at his house in Dover Street, London. He was buried at Wotten Church, where his wife joined him three years later.\n\nIn 1712, John Jackson married Will Hewer's niece, Ann Edgerly. Will provided Ann with \u00a33000 as her marriage portion. No doubt as Will smiled from earth at this union, Sam most surely smiled from above. The bond between Will and Sam was now cemented by marriage and their legacy of friendship lived on through the couple's many children.\n\nAfter Sam's death, Mary left Clapham and established herself in comfortable lodgings. She remained close to her sister and foster-sister. She died in her early sixties in 1715. John Jackson was the executor of her will and she left most of the items that Sam had given her to John and his family.\n\nFor all of the adventures Balty provided throughout Sam's Diary, little is known of his life or his family after Sam's death. Sadly, the last traces of Balty were petitions to the Cabinet in 1710, looking for their support (work or a pension).  The man who had put Sam through perhaps the longest and most stressful test of family obligation ever recorded is best eulogised in one sentence from Ollard, \"If Balthasar St. Michel had not existed only Dickens could have invented him\" (<cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p. 71).\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Hewer_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\" title=\"William Hewer by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/WillHewer.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Will Hewer\"></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Hewer_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\">William Hewer by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689</a></p>\n\nWill Hewer continued in his trade business, and twice was the Deputy Chairman of the old East India Company. Will ceased to hold office in 1712.  Will, who never married, lived until 1715. His memorial is in Clapham Church in the gallery which he had built. His books were sold by auction in 1730 (Lantham, p.184). Upon his death most of his property passed to his godson Hewer Edgerly, who was the son of his cousin Ann. The one condition Will requested was that he changed his surname to Hewer. His godson obliged and was further known as Edgerly Hewer.\n\nWill provided Edgerly Hewer's sister Ann (John's wife) with a dying bequest of \u00a31000.  John Jackson remained at Clapham and by all indications enjoyed raising his family. He died in 1724, at age fifty-one. Among his seven children, his daughter Frances, who inherited both the Pepys and the Hewer fortunes, founded the present Pepys Cockerell family\" (Heath, p.xxxi).\n\nIn July of 1724, the library, including the six volumes of the Diary, left Clapham and made its way to Magdalene, where it resides today.\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"284\" alt=\"The Pepys Library\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\">The Pepys Library in Magdalene College, Cambridge, by Andrew Dunn</a></p>\n\n## Books and article consulted and/or quoted \n\n* Astin, Marjorie: <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite>, 1929\n* Balleine, G.R.:  <cite>All for the King</cite>, 1976\n* Bastable, Jonathan:  <cite>Voices from the World of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 2007\n* Davidson, Lillias Campbell: <cite>Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a</cite>, 1908\n* De la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, Guy: <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 2006\n* De la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, Guy: <cite>Particular Friends: The Correspondence of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn</cite>, 1997\n* Evelyn, John: <cite>The Diary of John Evelyn</cite>\n* Heath, Helen Truesdell: <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and his Family Circle</cite>, 1955 \n* Howarth, R.G.: <cite>Letters and the Second Diary of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 1933\n* Hunt, Percival: <cite>Samuel Pepys in the Diary</cite>, 1958\n* Knighton.

Sam would find himself surviving the reigns of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">Charles II</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">James II</a> and William III and would see James's daughter Anne find her way to the throne. Along the way he would continue to excel in his naval accomplishments, assorted MP positions, his role in the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2984/\">Christ's Hospital</a>, his Fellowship and role as President of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4134/\">Royal Society</a>, among the highlights. He would welcome new friends and bid sad farewells to many of those we came to know so well in his Diary. But, as the Diary ended, all of those things were in the future and Sam was more concerned with his immediate plans, his desire to share some pleasurable time with his wife <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/\">Elizabeth</a>.</p>\n<h2>I. Elizabeth</h2>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_Pepys.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/ElizabethPepys_1666.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Elizabeth Pepys, 1666\" width=\"368\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elizabeth_Pepys.jpg\">Portrait of Elizabeth Pepys. An 1825 engraving of a painting by John Hayls, 1666</a></p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the Diary ended, Elizabeth and Sam traveled together to Paris with her brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/\">Balty</a>. In preparation for that trip Sam and his friend <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/\">John Evelyn</a> exchanged letters regarding Sam's upcoming travels. In his letter to Sam dated 21 August 1669, John shared with Sam pages of wonderful \"must see\" locations and letters of introduction. A small excerpt is below and the full letter <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1669/08/21/evelyn-to-pepys/\">is located here</a>\n(de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Particular Friends</cite>, p.68):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pray forget not to visit the Taille-Douce shops, and make Collection of what they have excellent, especially the Draughts of their Palaces, Churches, and Gardens, and the particulars you will have seen; they will greatly refresh you in your Study, and by the fire side, when you are many years return'd. Israel, Sylvestre, Morin, Chaveau, are great Masters, both for things of the kind extant, and Inventions extreamly pleasant. You will easily be acquainted with the best Painters, especially LeBrun, who is chief of them; and it would not be amiss to be present at their Acadamie, in which Monsieur du Bosse (a principal member) will conduct you. For the rest, I recommend you to God's Almighty Protection; augure you in a happy journey, and kissing you Lady's Hands remain,</p>\n<p>Sir, Your most humble and obedient Servant J. Evelyn</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Without Sam's meticulous Diary, there is little known about their actual adventures, but as Diary enthusiasts can imagine, any adventure that included Balty must have been filled with tall tales, merriment and perhaps a few headaches for Sam.  What is sadly known is that on the way home, while traveling through <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/\">Flanders</a>, Elizabeth became very ill with a fever. They arrived <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/\">home</a> in late October, as Elizabeth struggled with her illness. The severity of her situation obviously derailed the etiquette-aware Sam, as it was not until November 2, 1669 that Sam penned an apologetic letter to John Evelyn. In it he begged for forgiveness for not thanking him promptly and expressed his distress at Elizabeth's dire situation. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1669/11/02/pepys-to-evelyn/\">This letter</a> to a close and personal friend captures the severity of Elizabeth's illness and shows the emotional impact on Sam as he faced fears of her death (de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Particular Friends</cite>, p.76):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SIR. I beg you to believe that I would not have been ten days returned into England without waiting on you, had it not pleased God to afflict mee by the sickness of my wife, who, from the first day of her coming back to London, hath layn under a fever so severe as at this hour to render her recoverie desperate; which affliction hath very much unfitted me for those acts of civilities and respect which, amongst the first of my friends, I should have paid to yourselfe, as he to whom singly I owe the much greater part of the satisfaction I have met with in my late voyage. Next to you, I have my acknowledgements to make to Sir Samuel Tuke, to whom (when in a condition of doing it) I shall beg your introducing me, for the owning of my obligations to him on the like behalfe. But, Sir, I beg you heartily to dispense with the ceremonie, till I am better qualified for paying it; and in the meane time receive the enclosed, which I should with much more satisfaction have delivered with my owne hand. </p>\n<p>I am, Sir Your most obliged and obedient Servant. S. Pepys</p>\n<p>I most humbly kiss you ladies hands, and pray my service may be presented to Sir Richard Browne [John Evelyn's Father-in-law, the diplomatist]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Elizabeth neared death, Sam made arrangements for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1215/\">Milles</a>, the Rector of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/\">St Olave's</a>, to offer her a final sacrament. Although Elizabeth had professed her leanings towards <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/306/\">Catholicism</a> in the past (usually when angered by Sam), she received the Holy Sacrament according to the rites of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7542/\">Church of England</a>. She passed away shortly thereafter on November 10, 1669. The man who offered us so much of his personal insights in the Diary remains sadly silent to us during such a devastating loss.  Perhaps he chose to leave behind only his memories of her life and not her death. Ardent followers of the Diary no doubt can feel his pain as we remember their story in the pages of Sam's Diary. His entries, often filled with their arguments and jealousies, were also full of his loving reflections on Elizabeth's beauty and her dedication to him. After their difficulties of late over Sam's relationship with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11640/\">Deb Willet</a>, Sam and Elizabeth seemed to be moving towards a closer relationship.  Sam's 'poor wretch' was gone and the void she left was never filled.</p>\n<p>Sam commissioned a monument of Elizabeth as \"immortalised\" at St. Olave's (below) which captured her beauty and spirit. It was set at St. Olave's to face the Navy pew, where it remains today. Although we don't have the Diary to express Sam's loss, we do have the Latin epitaph that Sam wrote as a farewell to his beloved wife. </p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104352364/\" title=\"ElizabethPepys2 by Graham_T, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/36/104352364_0cd90438f6.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" alt=\"ElizabethPepys2\"></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamt/104352364/in/pool-73104548@N00/\">Photo by Graham Travis at Flickr</a></p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/#summary\">group translation by our annotators</a> of her epitaph  reads: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"center\">HERE LIES<br />\nELIZABETH PEPYS<br />\nTo Whom<br />\nSomerset gave her cradle, Octob: 23, 1640,</p>\n\n<table style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:1em;line-height:1.3em;\"><tr><td style=\"width:50%\">Andegavia gave<br />  \nHer Father of the glori-<br />  \nous house of St. Michel,  </td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Cumbria gave<br /> \nHer Mother of the noble<br />  \nstock of the Cliffords,</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>Wife of Samuel Pepys (who serves the Royal Navy)<br />\nShe was educated first in a convent, and then in a seminary of France.<br />\nShe was distinguished by the excellence of both at once;<br />\nGifted with beauty, accomplishments, tongues;<br />\nShe bore no offspring, for she could not have borne her like.<br />\nAt length, when she had bidden the world a gentle farewell,<br />\n(After a journey completed through, we may say, the lovelier sights of Europe)-<br />\nA returning pilgrim, she took her departure to wander through a grander world. </p>\n\n<p>She died the 10th of November In the 29th year of her age,<br />\nIn the 15th year of her marriage,<br />\nIn the year of our Lord 1669.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A selection from a belated letter which Sam sent to Captain Elliot dated 3 March 1670, to thank him for supporting him in his unsuccessful election contest some 4 months later follows. It gives an indication of the extent of the ongoing emotional impact of Sam's loss (de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, <cite>Letters of Samuel Pepys</cite>, p.84).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CAPTAIN ELLIOT, I beg you earnestly to believe that nothing but the sorrow and distraction I have been in by the death of my wife, increased by the suddenness with which it pleased God to surprise me with therewith, after a voyage so full of health and content, could have forced me to so long a neglect of my private concernments; this being, I do assure you, the very first day that my affliction, together with my daily attendance on other public occasions of his Majesty's, has suffered me to apply myself to the considering any part of my private concernments; among which, that of my doing right to you is no small particular: and therefore, as your charity will, I hope, excuse me for my not doing it sooner, so I pray you to accept now, as late as it is, my hearty thanks for your multiplied kindness in my late affair at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8279/\">Aldborough</a>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sam continued to support Elizabeth's parents <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/\">Alexandre</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/\">Dorothea St. Michel</a>, her brother Balty and his family throughout his life.  His unwavering devotion and loyalty to her memory is reflected in his generosity to her family. </p>\n<p>Coinciding with her illness and subsequent death, Sam found himself being pulled into the defense of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/\">Navy Office</a> against the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12029/\">Brooke House Commission's</a> accusations of corruption and inefficiency. After he buried Elizabeth at St. Olave's, he set out to successfully repudiate the claims against the Navy as well as those levied against him directly (accepting illegal fees). The Brooke House sittings went on for two months, as Sam awaited his fate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of his fellow officials at the Navy Board during the war, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/\">Batten</a> was dead and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/\">Penn</a> close to death -- he died in September 1670. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/\">Coventry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/\">Carteret</a> had left the board in 1667, Pett had been pushed out, and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/\">Sir John Mennes</a> was not held responsible for anything -- he died February 1671. Only <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/\">Brouncker</a> and Pepys remained of the old guard to take the blame. Neither lost his job. (Tomalin, p.281)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Life in Sam's personal circle moved on, as his sister <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/\">Pall</a> (married to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11931/\">John Jackson</a>) delivered a son, whom she named Samuel. In 1670 Sam helped secure Balty a permanent position as a Muster-Master at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/641/\">Deal</a> and helped his brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/\">John</a> to be appointed as Clerk to Trinity House (the seaman's foundation). Shortly thereafter Sam was admitted as an Elder Brother at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10531/\">Trinity House</a> and in 1676 become a Master.  Sam once again began to enjoy the friendships he had with John Evelyn, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/\">Anthony Deane</a>, and the Houblon family, who were merchants in the shipping and trade business, becoming closest to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/\">James</a> (who would prove a true friend to the end).  Around this time, Sam took in a housekeeper, Mary Skinner and the relationship developed into an affair. Sam would never marry her, but she would remain his faithful mistress, until his death.  Of course, without his Diary, it's hard to know how 'faithful' Sam was to her.</p>\n<h2>II. Lord Sandwich and the Third Dutch War</h2>\n<p>With the death of his beloved daughter <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2848/\">Paulina</a> in February 1669, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Lord Sandwich</a> left London and returned to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/\">Hinchingbrooke</a> where he spent two months grieving among his family. To paraphrase Ollard (<cite>Cromwell's Earl</cite>, p.248), since Sandwich's return from abroad his eldest son and heir <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/670/\">Ned</a> had married the loveable daughter of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11131/\">Lady Burlington</a>, bringing great joy to the family. There were four boys of school age or younger. Of the daughters, the family was pleased when <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/171/\">Anne</a> married Sir Richard Edgecumbe in January 1671.  During that month <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1507/\">Sydney</a>, Sandwich's favorite son, retuned from his grand European tour. After Sandwich's death Sydney would marry the great heiress Anne Wortley. Of the marriage between <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8250/\">Philip Carteret</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/\">Jemimah</a>, which Sam helped orchestrate and so well recorded, there were three grandchildren added to the family: \"George was born in 1667, Philip in 1669 and Edward in 1671. The birth of this last child cost Jemimah her life. She was buried at Hawnes Church on 21st November, and her baby was christened a week later.\" (Balleine,  p.162).</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lely,_Edward_Montagu.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/EdwardMontagu_1666.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Edward Montagu, 1666\" width=\"408\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lely,_Edward_Montagu.jpg\">Portrait of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, by Sir Peter Lely, 1666</a></p>\n\n<p>The Third Dutch War began in 1672, and Sandwich was called upon to command the flagship the <em><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3124/\">Royal James</a></em>.  During the battle at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8608/\">Sole Bay</a> on May 28th Sandwich</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>had been wounded slightly in the arm and thigh. His companions urged him to jump and swim for it but his bulk and general unwieldiness disinclined him. Perhaps the constricting formality of his clothes he had put on, the caparison of a commander leading his men into battle, further inhibited him. When his body was found in the water thirty miles away near a fortnight later he was still wearing his <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/859/\">Garter</a> ribbon. He had still been on board when everyone else who could stand had left the ship but the corpse showed no sign of scorching or singeing. The recognition that had been denied him in life was granted in death. [The King] gave orders that he should be buried at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/\">Westminster Abbey</a> with the magnificence of a great public occasion.\" (Ollard, <cite>Cromwell's Earl</cite>, p.262).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>John Evelyn, upon the loss of his esteemed friend, recorded his thoughts in his Diary entry of May 31, 1772:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My L: Sandwich was prudent as well as Valiant, &amp; allways govern'd his affairs with successe, and little losse, he was for deliberation &amp; reason... Thus this gallant Person perish'd ... &amp; deplorable was the losse, of one of the best accomplish[ed] persons, not onely of this Nation but of any other: He was learned in Mathematics, in Musique, in Sea affaires, in Political: Had ben divers Embassies, was of a sweet obliging temper, Sober, Chast, infinitly ingenious &amp; a true noble man, an ornament to the Court &amp; his Prince, nor has he left any that approach his many Virtues behind him ... I am yet heartily griev'd at this mightly losse, nor do I call it to my thoughts without emotion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the friendship between Lord Sandwich and Sam had cooled over the years, perhaps due to a combination of Sam's independent rising in stature and lingering resentment of Sam's <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/18/\">\"great letter of reproof\"</a>, Sam walked as a banner-bearer in the funeral processions, but Lord Sandwich did not mention him in his will. </p>\n<p>Another loss of life aboard the <em>Royal James</em>, was Sandwich's son-in-law Philip Carteret (husband of the late Jemimah) who was Sandwich's Lieutenant on the ship. Upon his death, the three children of the Carteret-Sandwich union were now orphaned. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/\">Sir George Carteret</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/\">Lady Carteret</a> moved to Hawes (Philip's residence) and lived there with their grandchildren for the rest of their lives.  Lady Sandwich left Hinchingbrooke, her home of thirty years, and went to live with her daughter Anne, where she died two years later.  </p>\n<h2>III. Secretary of the \"New\" Admiralty</h2>\n<p>1672 brought the death of Elizabeth's father, Alexandre St Michel and Sam's <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/\">Uncle Wight</a>. Shortly thereafter <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/\">Mary Mercer</a>, Elizabeth's Diary companion was gone. A loss of a different nature was brought about by the fire at the Navy offices in early 1673. Sam's house was burnt to the ground, but somehow he saved the six volumes of his Diary, if little else. The home he enjoyed for so many years of the Diary, where he rose in his career, built up his proud possessions, shared times with friends, and which held memories of his wife, was now gone. </p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_diary_manuscript_volumes.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/DiaryVolumes.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" alt=\"Diary Volumes\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_diary_manuscript_volumes.jpg\">Bound volumes of Samuel Pepys' diary</a></p>\n\n<p>The year did bring some good news as Pall gave birth to her son John Jackson. Sam became involved in the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, and was soon after appointed Governor of the hospital. After the fire, the Navy moved him to Winchester Street. With the introduction of the Test Act, which excluded Catholics from office, James II was forced to resign as the Lord High Admiral of the Navy. The King replaced the Duke's position with a group of Admiralty Commissioners. Pepys was appointed Secretary of the Admiralty and in 1674 moved to the Admiralty Office at Derby House. His old position as <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/484/\">Clerk of the Acts</a> was split between his brother John and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/\">Tom Hayter</a>. Pepys asserted his role and used his exceptional public speaking abilities to present an account of the navy and to secure the \u00a3600,000 needed for thirty new ships. His major accomplishment was his proposal that </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>no one should be appointed as lieutenant until he had served for three years, received a certificate from his captain and passed an examination in navigation and seamanship at the Navy Office... Pepys had made history at a stroke, bringing about a revolution in the way the navy was run, fired by his belief that education and intelligence were more useful to the nation than family background and money; and that however courageous 'gentlemen' captains might be, the service needed to be professionalized. (Tomalin, p.297).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The King apparently agreed with Sam's thoughts on the necessity of education in naval affairs and also granted his later request of funds for a mathematical endowment for Christ's Hospital School where boys could be properly prepared for the navy. </p>\n<p>Sam's accomplishments and positions increased as he was elected MP for Castle Rising, Norfolk, appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital, elected a Master of Trinity House and soon after elected a Master of the Clothworkers Company. Amidst all of this good news, Sam was to suffer unexpected sadness at the loss of his brother John, who died in the spring of 1677. Shortly thereafter, Sam's old amour of the Diary, Deb Willet, who had married and remained in London, died. There is correspondence to show that while she was alive, Sam assisted her husband, a theology graduate, to obtain a position as a ship's chaplain. It is not known if Sam continued any type of sexual or other relationship with Deb, but it seems quite plausible. </p>\n<h2>IV. Perils of the Popish Plots</h2>\n<p>The changing political scene and the rise of anti-Catholic activities began to turn against Sam. Throughout Charles II's reign, a political plot worked against James, the Duke of York and a number of other Papists in high places (including <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a>). The plots were intended to discredit Catholics who were close to the King, with the hope to gain control of the succession of the Crown. </p>\n<p>In 1678, these clandestine plans would prove \"personal\" (Heath, p.xiii) and involve Sam, with the hopes to reflect poorly upon his patron, James, the Duke of York. This activity was part of the overall Popish Plots. During this time, the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a well known <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7980/\">Protestant</a> magistrate, opened a huge opportunity for the conspirators to blame the Papists for his death. Helen Heath explains that the original plan may have been to implicate Sam in the murder of Godfrey. Luckily, Sam was away at the time of the murder so the conspirators went after his clerk, Samuel Atkins. The evidence proved so false that the boy was released.</p>\n<p>As the political players shifted, Sam was no longer wanted as MP at Castle Rising, but was elected along with Anthony Deane as MP at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/\">Harwich</a> (Tomalin, p.311). The Admiralty Commission was dissolved and a new one appointed with people who were not favorably disposed towards Sam. In a political move, the King sent his brother the Duke of York abroad, which did not bode well for Sam, who was to become the next target. </p>\n<p>Hooligans, who were believed to have been bribed by those working on the behalf of Lord Shaftesbury, were pulled together to bring false charges against Sam and Deane which included providing information to the French (treason), piracy, and in Pepys' case, being a Catholic. Sam's accuser on the treason charges was Colonel John Scott. The piracy charge (more directed toward Deane) was brought by Captain Moore and the accusations of being a Catholic came from a former servant of Sam's, John James. As Sam was sent to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/\">the Tower</a>, he resigned as the Secretary of the Admiralty and the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/\">Treasurer of Tangier</a>.</p>\n<p>As a response to the accusations of Catholicism, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/1673/02/08/st-michel-to-pepys/\">Balty penned a letter</a>, with the intent of \"proving\" that the charges of Popery in Sam's home were false and misleading. Although the readers of the Diary will all know that Elizabeth had a leaning towards Catholicism, the letter provided Sam with an endorsement and allows readers  to hear the incredibly melodramatic \"voice\" of Balty at his best.  </p>\n<p>Sam, who has been a faithful servant to King Charles, was left without any public support from the King he served so well. Charles, who was solely interested in maintaining the throne, had to let the proceedings carry out without intervention. Charles only intervened with an uncharacteristic and vehement support when his neglected Queen Catherine was falsely accused of involvement in an attempted murder plot against him. Charles publicly defended her and as her letters reveal (Davidson, p.456) Charles went so far as to secure a secret getaway to France if it appeared that the opposing forces would try to imprison her. </p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Titus_Oates1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/PopishPlots.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" alt=\"Popish Plots\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Titus_Oates1.jpg\">Titus Oates accused James I's secretary, Edward Coleman, of being involved in the Popish Plot. This picture of Coleman appeared on the songsheet, <cite>The Plotter Executed</cite> (1678)</a></p>\n\n<p>For Sam, now in prison, there was no such royal support and a desperate need to clear his name. From behind the Tower walls, Sam realised he needed to manage his own defence. From his cell, Sam was left to rely on his network of friends, professional and political contacts (many of whom had to work undercover so as not to be associated with an accused traitor), and someone who could infiltrate the world of the slippery Colonel Scott. There was a need for \"spy\" work to be done in France in order to discredit and prove his accuser, Colonel Scott a liar. To his credit, and, most likely to the amazement of many Diary readers, Balty rose magnificently to the occasion and herein proved his greatest service to Sam. In spite of all his flaws and failures he went to France to pursue  \"a sort of double life between the wealthy merchants of Pepys' acquaintance, on the one hand, and the rogues and vagabonds who consorted  with the nefarious Colonel Scott on the other\" (Heath, p.xxv).  Balty enjoyed an 'all expenses paid' vacation and Sam had his French spy, looking for credible enemies of Scott (there were plenty) who would come forth to speak out and discredit him.</p>\n<p>As 1679 progressed, Sam's friends, among them James Houblon, put up bail. Sam left the Tower and went to live with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/\">Will Hewer</a>, who was already providing housing for Balty's <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/\">wife</a> and children while Balty was in France. As evidence against John Scott began to pile up, he went abroad. John James, who was ill and perhaps wanted to die with a clear conscience, gave a statement that he had been paid to bring false statements against Sam. Without any concrete evidence against him, by June of the next year all proceedings against Sam were finally dropped. </p>\n<iframe width=\"460\" height=\"264\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nzm1FsqXj7M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzm1FsqXj7M\">A video of where Pepys lived from 1679-1688, and the York Stairs water gate where he would have gone down to the River Thames. By Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re</a></p>\n\n<p>Sam's moment of relief was not long enjoyed, as his brother-in-law John Jackson and then <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/\">his father</a> died by the end of the year, leaving Sam estates to settle, a house to care for and a widowed sister with two sons who would no doubt need his oversight. Sam found schooling for Pall's sons, he secured a position for Balty in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/\">Tangier</a> and set his wife Esther and children to live in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4914/\">Brampton</a>. Sam remained in London, living with his friend Will Hewer, who by now had amassed significant money from his dealing in trade. Hewer, whose fortunes would grow substantially over the years, continued to graciously welcome Sam and his circle into his homes.</p>\n<p>In 1681, upon the death of her husband <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/\">Tom Edwards</a>, Sam's beloved <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/\">Jane</a> returned to his service in order to support her two children. Sam took good care to get her eldest son and his godson (also named Samuel) a place in Christ's Church to study mathematics. Jane married but was soon widowed again. As a statement of his devotion to his old friend, in 1690 Sam \"settled an annuity of \u00a315 a year on her\" (Tomalin, p.244).</p>\n<p>Now, Sam found himself unemployed. He spent the next years rather out of the public eye, but did attend the King and Duke of York in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7005/\">Newcastle</a>, where he recorded the King's great escape from the Battle of Worcester. He also attended the Duke of York on several occasions. </p>\n<h2>V.  Return to Public Service</h2>\n<p>In 1683 the King sent Sam on an undisclosed trip accompanying Lord Dartmouth. Sam was able to take Will Hewer and they departed, only later to find that the secret purpose was to evacuate Tangier and destroy everything that remained behind. As that operation progressed Sam and Will took a side trip to Spain, which was miserable weather wise, but which added some rarities for his library. Sam received his first pay in years and was given \u00a31000. More important he was given an entr\u00e9e back into the navy. In 1684 the King determined that he would take the role Lord High Admiral and would be assisted by the Duke of York. In June Sam was given a new position created for him by the King as the Secretary of the Affairs of the Admiralty. </p>\n<p>That year, Sam, who had been a member of the Royal Society since 1665, was elected as President, a role that he maintained for two years. Although not a scientist by nature, Sam's administrative talents were a welcome contribution. The Royal Society was an excellent place for Sam to indulge his curiosity, enjoy interesting conversations and mix with such prominent scientists of the day such as Sir Issac Newton, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8282/\">Robert Boyle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8179/\">Robert Hooke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9711/\">Christopher Wren</a>). During his presidency, Newton's <cite>Principia Mathematica</cite> was published and its title page included Pepys' name.</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prinicipia-title.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/Principia-title.png\" width=\"233\" height=\"327\" alt=\"Principia Mathematica title page\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prinicipia-title.png\"><cite>Principia Mathematica</cite> title page</a></p>\n\n<p>King Charles II died in 1685 and was succeeded by his brother James. Sam attended the Duke of York's coronation as King James II as a Baron of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/614/\">Cinque Ports</a>. Sam maintained his Secretary position for James II. He was reelected MP for Harwich and appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Huntingdonshire. By July he was appointed a Master at Trinity House for a second time (Ollard's Chronology from <cite>Pepys</cite>, p.378).</p>\n<p>In January 1686, Sam presented James II with a review of the navy which criticised those who had run it in his absence. He requested and was granted a \"Special Commission\" to make well managed and necessary ship repairs. The Commission would sit for three years. Sam drafted the terms of the Commission and handpicked its Commissioners who included those he knew he could rely on (Anthony Deane, Will Hewer and rather surprisingly Balty). The Special Commission first sat in March 1686. John Ehrman's quote (Ollard, <cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p.311) details the rebuilding of the fleet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The outstanding work of the Commission, however, lay in its programme of repair. Its success rested upon three distinct achievements. First, the repairs were fully and efficiently carried out; secondly, they did not exceed the original estimate of their cost; and thirdly, they were completed in less than the original estimate of time required. All of these facts were later questioned, but all were finally established by the Parliament inquiry of 1691-2, in its election of a defence of their work from Deane and Hewer, the two men principally concerned, and in the detailed acknowledgement of its validity by the Parliamentary Commissioners themselves. </p>\n<p>Altogether the Special Commission repaired 69 ships and rebuilt twenty. It also built the three fourth-rates promised, and a <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2705/\">hoy</a> and two <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/\">lighters</a>. By the time it came to a close, only four ships remained and their repairs not completed, and four more with their repairs not begun. In addition to the work on these 96 ships, a further 29 were repaired which had been at sea when the Commission was inaugurated, and had not been included in the original programme. Pepys's intentions were therefore more than fulfilled in the number of vessels which were tackled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tomalin (p.337-8) offers a wonderful account of the status of Sam's personal circle during this time, as paraphrased here. Sam succeeded in getting Balty installed in the former Treasurer's House in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/\">Deptford</a>. \"This was the high point of Balty's career, and at the end of 1686 Pepys urged him to take responsibility for his own future, warning him that he himself had lost strength and was suffering from a new <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/346/\">kidney stone</a> and ulcer.\"</p>\n<p>At this point, his wife Esther who was pregnant with their seventh child, died in childbirth. Balty had neither the skills not inclination to manage his financial future and would continue to rely on Sam. Sam's sister Pall remained in Brampton and of her two sons, Samuel, who was a less than a stellar learner, was sent to sea at age fifteen. The younger son John Jackson, who showed promise, was entered a pensioner at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/419/\">Magdalene</a>. From all indications, John was aware that he needed to work hard and was capable of doing so.</p>\n<p>Of his 'extended family', Sam saw Jane [Birch] Edward's son \"presented to the king and the lord mayor along with other boys of the mathematics department\". Of the next generation of children (Balty's and Pall's), John Jackson was emerging in Sam's eyes as the most promising.</p>\n<p>On a sad note, the year brought the loss of two old friends, first Sam's respected and dignified friend William Coventry and later, a friend of an altogether totally different ilk, the 'pleasurable' <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/\">Betty Martin</a>.</p>\n<p>The Special Commission was dissolved ahead of schedule in October of 1688, due to its considerable success. Although Sam had intended these upgrades in support of James II, in November <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/\">William of Orange</a> landed in Torbay and by December James II had fled.  As can be expected William's reign brought a quick purge of those loyal to James II. Sam lost his MP role for Harwich and resigned as Secretary of the Admiralty and from his Trinity House position. Deane and Hewer also resigned their naval positions, while Balty was dismissed.</p>\n<p>Balty married Margaret Darling, a widow with two children of her own.He now had 9-10 (sources vary) children to provide for and had no job, savings, or pension. On Balty's behalf, Sam wrote several letters, which led to the King's letter to the Commissioner of the Navy, requesting that they examine the case of Balty's service and find employment for him.  This request was unsuccessful. During this time, there appears to have been a falling out between Sam and Balty, for which most biographers conjecture was due to an argument over the position of Sam's housekeeper, Mary Skinner. This letter from Balty to Sam perhaps caused or further widened the breach between them. (Heath, p.223-4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deptford, May 28, 1689</p>\n<p>Honoured Sir:</p>\n<p>After my late haveing groaned under Sume trubles (on my private Account) which at this unfortunate juncture of time have prooved extreame heavy and Grivious to me; I understand that by the malicious inventive ill Offices of a female Beast, which you keepe, I am like allsoe to lye under your Anger and disgrace (to me more insuportable than the former) but I hope, and humble pray, (though she tould me impudently, and arogantly, you Scorned to see me) that with your Generous Usuall goodness, wisdome, manhood, and former kindness you will not damn him Unheard who Shoulde Joy to hazard (as in duty bound) his dearest Bludd for your Service. The meane while, returning your honour my most humble and harty thanks for the Petition you sent me, and for all other your many favours I remaine</p>\n<p>Your Ever Dutifull and most faithfull humble Servant  &nbsp; &nbsp;   B ST MICHEL</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this time on Balty was not welcome. Recorded letters to date seem to indicate that Sam stopped writing to Balty. From Balty's letters he was soon reduced to begging: \"if you have any Spare Cast-off Morning Gowne, Peruiques, and Some like Cast off large Cloake-Coate, which things you could Spare without the least inconveniency to you, if you woold Spare them to your Afflicted Servant they woold be very welcome and with Milions of thanks...\" (Heath, p.229). Although it's not clear what allowances  Sam may have made for Balty over the continuing years, what is known is that  Sam continued (although unsuccessfully) to write letters on Balty's behalf with the intent to have his old age officially provided for.</p>\n<p>Sam had two short imprisonments during the French invasion scares of 1689 and 1690. In November of 1689, Pall died and was buried at Brampton. Sam \"had a memorial stone  put up in the aisle of Brampton Church -- it can still be seen there\" (Tomalin, p.347). Sam also let out Brampton.  In December of 1690 Sam published his Memoirs of the Royal Navy 1679-88.</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/SamuelPepys_1689.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Samuel Pepys, 1689\" width=\"412\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\">Portrait of Samuel Pepys by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689</a></p>\n\n<h2>VI. Sam's Last Chapter</h2>\n<p>With retirement, Sam turned his focus to the things he truly treasured: wonderful conversations with friends, collecting his notes for a (never published) History of the Navy and working on his beloved library. Pall's youngest son, John Jackson, whom Sam had a sincere affection for, had finished his time at Magdalene college and now moved into Sam's home in the York Buildings to be his personal clerk, copying manuscripts and assisting with the library. There is an indication that the relationship between John and Mary Skinner was not always smooth (perhaps mistrust between them), so one can assume that retirement did not bring Sam total household peace.</p>\n<p>In September of 1693, Sam had an unsettling experience while on the way to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2610/\">Chelsea</a>. Sam, his lady friends and John, were robbed by two masked men. Although they were quite frightened, they were not harmed. Two of the robbers were caught, tried and hanged.</p>\n<p>By 1694, Sam saw John elected to the Royal Society. Pall's oldest son, Samuel, had returned from his ship duties and managed the Brampton estate. Coinciding with these events, Sam began to face several periods of illness and traveled back and forth to the country (Will Clapham's estate) where he would find rest and recovery.  Will, Sam's devoted lifelong friend, always made sure he was warmly welcomed and cared for. Will kept actively involved in his trade business, becoming Director of the old <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2494/\">East India Company</a> from 1698-1703. </p>\n<p>Sam continued to correspond and enjoy the company of friends as he was able. He put his energies into planning John's \"Grand Tour\" of Europe. The intent of a young man's tour of this type was to broaden their education and provide introductions to prominent people. In the case of this trip, John was also given the task of collecting books for Sam's growing library, which would eventually include more than three thousand volumes. Sam's friend James Houblon was instrumental at providing itineraries, guides, and introductions for John's adventures.</p>\n<p>John departed in 1699. Sam, whose fondness for John had grown, missed him dearly. While Sam filled his time having a desk and bookcase built for his library, the two corresponded frequently. Sam, who may have been reminiscing of the past, sent a rather touching note to John in regards to the Dowager Queen Catherine of Braganza. In 1700, while John was in Portugal, Sam asked him to \"wait on Lady Tuke, and if the honour of kissing the hand of the Queen-Dowager were offered him, to be sure to present to that royal lady, whom he [Sam] held in great honour, his profoundest duty.\" (Davidson, p.481).</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_John_Closterman.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/SamuelPepys_1690s.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Samuel Pepys, 1690s\" width=\"398\" height=\"500\"/><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Pepys_by_John_Closterman.jpg\">Portrait of Samuel Pepys by John Closterman, 1690s</a></p>\n\n<p>Sam's dear friend James Houblon, whose wife <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8397/\">Sarah</a> had recently died, sadly joined her. Of this significant loss, Sam wrote \"one of the longest and well as most approved friends till now left me in the world\" (Tomalin, p.362). In 1701, there was another loss, for which Sam may have had a private smile, knowing he outlived his rival of the Diary, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/\">John Creed</a>.  </p>\n<p>In June of 1701, Sam, who had spent his retirement traveling back and forth between London and Clapham, permanently moved to Clapham. Sam was very ill and wrote to John requesting his return. John arrived back in August and was put in charge of Sam's library.</p>\n<p>In August 1701, Sam wrote his will, leaving Hewer as executor and providing him \u00a3500. He noted his annuity to Jane and left Brampton to his nephew Samuel. Shortly thereafter, Sam angrily discovered that Samuel had married without his consult or consent, a choice that would later cost him dearly. </p>\n<p>In 1702 the massive task of relocating Sam's library to Clapham was successfully completed.  Sam was now surrounded by the people he most loved; John, Mary and Will, along with the collection he cherished. He would live out his remaining days with his Diary close by.</p>\n<p>Sam outlived William III, and Queen Anne was crowned. By 1703, it appeared that Sam knew he was not long for this world. He turned his attentions to take care of those he loved and those he still felt an obligation towards. The last letter Sam wrote was to Sir George Rooke, Commander in Chief of the Fleete, where he made a last plea for a pension for Balty. It is not known if the two ever reconciled or if Balty visited Sam in his last days.</p>\n<p>As he was nearing the end, Sam made dramatic changes to his will with two major codicils. The first codicil took away Brampton from Samuel and gave it to John. Sam then settled on a \u00a340 annuity a year for Samuel. The major part of Sam's estate went to John. Sam's library was put into Trust and John and Will Hewer would have joint responsibility for it. Upon John's death, the library was to be left for posterity. The collection was to remain intact and go to a university, preferably the library of Magdalene, with the stipulation that the </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>collection must be kept entire and separate, in a room to be chosen by Jackson in the new building, no one allowed to remove any books except the master, and he only as far as to his lodge. [Sam] proposed a system of annual visitation by Trinity to check that his instructions were being obeyed in perpetuity, giving them the right to the library if they found any infringement by Magdalene\" (Tomalin, p.367).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second codicil acknowledged his companion, Mary Skinner:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whereas I hold myself obliged on this occasion to leave behind me the most full and lasting acknowledgement of my esteem respect and gratitude to the Excellent Lady Mrs. Mary Skyner for the many important Effects of her Steddy friendship and Assistances during the whole course of my life, within the last thirty three years; I doe give and devise unto the said Mrs. Mary Skyner One Annuity or yearly payment of Two hundred pounds of lawful money of England for and during the terms of her natural Life. (Tomalin, p.367-8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A smaller codicil provided \u00a350 of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/\">plate</a> for Mary, Will and John, and left pictures to Mary. Sam also had an estimated \u00a328,000 due to him from the Crown which was never to be paid, and therefore never dispersed per the directives he set forth. </p>\n<p>On May 14th John Evelyn, Sam's last remaining friend of his intimate circle, now 82, visited Sam for the last time. John was recovering from a broken leg. This friendship, so wonderfully recorded in the letters between them through the years, remained solid until the end.</p>\n<p>As death neared, Sam was constantly cared for by Will, Mary and John. On Monday, May 26th Dr. Hickes, who would also conduct Sam's funeral, arrived to give Sam his final sacraments. He later wrote to his friend Charlett (Ollard, <cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p.368): </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The greatness of his behaviour, in his long and sharp tryall before his death, was in every respect answerable to his great life; and I believe no man ever went out of this world with greater contempt of it, or a more lively faith in every  thing that was revealed of the world to come. I administered the Holy Sacrament twice in his illness to him, and had administered it a third time, but for a sudden fit of illness that happened at the appointed time of administering of it. Twice I gave him the absolution of the Church, which he desired, and received with all reverence and comfort; and I never attended any sick or dying person that dyed with some much Christian greatnesse of mind, or a more lively sense of immortality, or so much fortitude and patience, in so long and sharp a tryall, or greater resignation to the will, which he most devoutly acknowledged to be the wisdom of God; and I doubt not but he is now a very blessed spirit, according to his motto, 'Mens cujusque is est quisque'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps there is no one better than John Evelyn to leave behind a touching eulogy for a life so fully lived. Evelyn's May 26, 1703 Diary entry on the death of his friend Samuel Pepys (Bastable, p.266):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May 26th. This day died Mr. Sam. Pepys, a very worthy, industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed thro' all the most considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty, all which he perform'd with great integrity. When K. James II went out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more, but withdrawing himselfe from all public affaires, he liv'd at Clapham with his partner Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and sweete place, where he enjoy'd the fruits of his labours in greate prosperity. He was universally belov'd, hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skill'd in music, a very greate cherisher of learned men of whom he had the conversation. His library and collection of other curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships especially. Beside what he publish'd of an account of the Navy, as he found and left it, he had for divers yeares under his hand the History of the Navy, or Navalia as he call'd it; but how far advanc'd, and what will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son Mr. Jackson, a young gentleman whom Mr. Pepys had educated in all sorts of usefull learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he return's with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir. Mr. Pepys had been for neere 40 years so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies, but in my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sam's funeral took place on the evening of June 4th. Per Sam's directive he was to be buried alongside his wife, Elizabeth. Sam was</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>buried in front of the altar at St Olave's ... Elizabeth's bust looked down on a gathering of representatives of almost every stage and facet of her husband's career. Balty was there, supported by one of his daughters. The second Earl of Sandwich and his brother the Dean of Durham sat next to them. A host of Pepys's relations and connections echo the pages of the Diary. His doctors, his banker his book-binder, his lawyer: the Clapham household, the Hewer clan, the President and many of the Fellows of the Royal Society, the Dean of Christ's Church and the Master of Trinity, even the venerable Dr. Wallis swelled the crowd. The Board of the Admiralty were there in force and both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, though it was the non-juror Hickes who took the service. As in life, so at the commendation of his soul to God there was room for the people who had loved and served him as well as for the famous and the talented.

Final Farewells</h2>\n<p>After Sam's death, John Jackson moved to the Hewer household and took formal responsibility for the library. Per Sam's request, he contacted and then visited Magdalene to select the rooms for the library. \"During 1705 the catalogue was completed, the last bookcases installed, and the whole of Pepys  collection, including his model shops, portraits and some of his furniture, put on display in Clapham\" (Tomalin, p.372).</p>\n<p>Sam's friend John Evelyn outlived Sam by three years, spending his final years with his wife Mary at his house in Dover Street, London. He was buried at Wotten Church, where his wife joined him three years later.</p>\n<p>In 1712, John Jackson married Will Hewer's niece, Ann Edgerly. Will provided Ann with \u00a33000 as her marriage portion. No doubt as Will smiled from earth at this union, Sam most surely smiled from above. The bond between Will and Sam was now cemented by marriage and their legacy of friendship lived on through the couple's many children.</p>\n<p>After Sam's death, Mary left Clapham and established herself in comfortable lodgings. She remained close to her sister and foster-sister. She died in her early sixties in 1715. John Jackson was the executor of her will and she left most of the items that Sam had given her to John and his family.</p>\n<p>For all of the adventures Balty provided throughout Sam's Diary, little is known of his life or his family after Sam's death. Sadly, the last traces of Balty were petitions to the Cabinet in 1710, looking for their support (work or a pension).  The man who had put Sam through perhaps the longest and most stressful test of family obligation ever recorded is best eulogised in one sentence from Ollard, \"If Balthasar St. Michel had not existed only Dickens could have invented him\" (<cite>Pepys: A Biography</cite>, p. 71).</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Hewer_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\" title=\"William Hewer by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/WillHewer.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Will Hewer\"></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Hewer_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller_1689.jpg\">William Hewer by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1689</a></p>\n\n<p>Will Hewer continued in his trade business, and twice was the Deputy Chairman of the old East India Company. Will ceased to hold office in 1712.  Will, who never married, lived until 1715. His memorial is in Clapham Church in the gallery which he had built. His books were sold by auction in 1730 (Lantham, p.184). Upon his death most of his property passed to his godson Hewer Edgerly, who was the son of his cousin Ann. The one condition Will requested was that he changed his surname to Hewer. His godson obliged and was further known as Edgerly Hewer.</p>\n<p>Will provided Edgerly Hewer's sister Ann (John's wife) with a dying bequest of \u00a31000.  John Jackson remained at Clapham and by all indications enjoyed raising his family. He died in 1724, at age fifty-one. Among his seven children, his daughter Frances, who inherited both the Pepys and the Hewer fortunes, founded the present Pepys Cockerell family\" (Heath, p.xxxi).</p>\n<p>In July of 1724, the library, including the six volumes of the Diary, left Clapham and made its way to Magdalene, where it resides today.</p>\n<p class=\"illustration\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/images/2012/05/31/PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"284\" alt=\"The Pepys Library\" /></a><br /><a class=\"caption\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PepysLibraryCambridge.jpg\">The Pepys Library in Magdalene College, Cambridge, by Andrew Dunn</a></p>\n\n<h2>Books and article consulted and/or quoted</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Astin, Marjorie: <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite>, 1929</li>\n<li>Balleine, G.R.:  <cite>All for the King</cite>, 1976</li>\n<li>Bastable, Jonathan:  <cite>Voices from the World of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 2007</li>\n<li>Davidson, Lillias Campbell: <cite>Catherine of Bragan\u00e7a</cite>, 1908</li>\n<li>De la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, Guy: <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 2006</li>\n<li>De la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re, Guy: <cite>Particular Friends: The Correspondence of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn</cite>, 1997</li>\n<li>Evelyn, John: <cite>The Diary of John Evelyn</cite></li>\n<li>Heath, Helen Truesdell: <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and his Family Circle</cite>, 1955 </li>\n<li>Howarth, R.G.: <cite>Letters and the Second Diary of Samuel Pepys</cite>, 1933</li>\n<li>Hunt, Percival: <cite>Samuel Pepys in the Diary</cite>, 1958</li>\n<li>Knighton.

The houses belonging to the Navy Office on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6920/\">Seething Lane</a> all looked very attractive (\"the worst very good\") and his first thought was that he risked being \"shuffled out\" by the older, more powerful men he was working alongside. It would be a huge step up from his current <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/102/\">\"little house\"</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6919/\">Axe Yard</a>, in the sprawling complex of Westminster.  When just a week later he noticed a \"busy fellow come to look out the best lodgings for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/\">Lord Berkely</a>\", he acted quickly and decisively. He finished the business of the day and then rushed home to Axe Yard, gathered up a pair of sheets and hurried to the Navy Office, where he boldly knocked on the door of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/637/\">Commissioner Willoughby's</a> house, to which he had taken a fancy, and invited himself in for the night. \"where I was received by him very civilly and slept well\". </p>\n\n<p>Two days later he took <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/\">his wife</a> to see <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/\">\"my house\"</a> and records that they were both \"mightily pleased\". They moved in on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/07/17/\">17th July</a>, by which time Sam had already got the Navy carpenters to create a door out of their chamber onto the flat, leaded roof space (\"<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1262/\">the leads</a>\"); he was looking forward to airing himself on the roof, with a view over the Navy Office site with its extensive gardens. </p>\n\n<p>No time was wasted in ordering further improvements. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/09/06/\">6th September</a> the joiners were in, putting a new floor in the dining room, on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/09/25/\">25th</a> there were plasterers in all the rooms and by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/04/\">4th October</a> the painters were busy. Elizabeth bought a new bed and furniture for her chamber. On the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/09/\">9th</a> the upholsterer was putting up new hangings in Elizabeth's chamber and on the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/13/\">13th</a> Pepys set up his bookshelves in his study/closet. By <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/19/\">19th October</a>, the ground floor dining room was finished with green serge hangings and \"gilt leather\" (leather with a gilded and coloured embossed pattern) on the walls.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n\n<p>Young Sam's instincts in claiming a house for himself were well-founded. Powerful and experienced men were also moving in all around him and there was a certain amount of jostling. Sam found that another, more senior neighbour <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/\">Sir William Batten</a> had \"stopped up\" one of his cellar windows and he called the carpenters in to create a new one. Sadly \"going down into my cellar to look, I put my foot into a great heap of ..., by which I find <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/\">Mr Turner's</a> <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1387/\">house of office</a> is full and comes into my cellar\". Thomas Turner was a senior clerk at the Navy Office.

Their first action was to wait until Sam was out at work and then to send their servants in to break down his chamber door and block up the newly made door onto the leads, which Sam had apparently done without permission. The comptroller <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1269/\">Sir Robert Slingsby</a> didn't side with the young Pepys, saying only that he didn't want to offend Lady Davis. Things got worse; on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/11/12/\">12th November</a>, foul water started coming into the parlour under the wall adjoining the Davis' house. Presumably whatever had caused the leak was repaired because on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/12/17/\">17th December</a> Sam happily recorded that \"this day my parlour is gilded\", in time for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/314/\">Christmas</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Come the Spring and a new staircase was being constructed, going up from the parlour. It may have been intricately carved as Sam later submitted a bill on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/09/01/\">1st September 1663</a> for 21<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for all the \"carved work\" he had installed, which the Navy kindly paid. The diary records that he was delighted but also guilty for this \"vanity\". While the new staircase was being installed on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/03/27/\">27th March 1661</a>, it had to be temporarily replaced with a ladder; Elizabeth stayed up in her room all day. </p>\n\n<p>Finally a new coat of paint was applied to the whole house and on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/06/21/\">21st June 1661</a>, there were new green curtains in the parlour and the painters had finished at last.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1662/06/\">June 1662</a>, Navy joiners built the wooden frames to create a third storey for Pepys' and Batten's houses. This work took several months, including a time when Sam had to remove his belongings to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/\">Sir William Penn's</a> house (Penn was away) and then when Penn returned unexpectedly, had to rely on the good offices of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/\">Griffith</a> the caretaker to find him alternative lodgings. A junior clerk was persuaded by Griffith to move out of his rooms on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/\">Tower Hill</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/08/30/\">30th August</a>, \"he do provide himself elsewhere and I am to have his chamber\". </p>\n\n<p>Pepys soon found himself with another new neighbour. The Davises moved with Lord Berkeley to Ireland and their lodgings, above the Turners, were taken over by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/\">Sir John Mennes</a>. He was soon complaining that the new storey had blocked the light onto his stairway and access to his house of office on the leads (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/09/08/\">8 September 1662</a>). Pepys thought he had reassured him but a few days later Mennes took <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/\">Sir William Coventry</a> with Pepys to look at how the building work had \"blinded all his lights and stopped up his garden door\". He was also outraged that one of Pepys' servants had been looking in at his window.</p>\n\n<p>The major worry for Pepys at this time was that Mennes might revenge himself by claiming the first floor \"best chamber\" as part of his own lodgings. The plasterer and bricklayer who had created the original dividing walls reassured him that the room belonged to his part of the property but he worried about it in his diary for weeks to come.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-location\">Location and layout</h3>\n\n<p>The Navy Office site was acquired initially by the Commonwealth Government for the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/\">Navy Board</a> in 1654 from John Wolstenholme who had suffered a financial reversal. It was bounded on the west by Seething Lane (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/04/29/\">29th April 1667</a> Pepys went out into \"our Lane\" to observe a fire in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1284/\">Southwark</a>) and to the North by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10032/\">Crutched Friars</a> and Hart St (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/05/09/\">9th Septmber 1667</a> \"our Street\" is where the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10546/\">Three Tuns Tavern</a> was, where two brothers fought and one was killed.)</p>\n\n<p>At the time the Navy Board must have been relieved to get away from their previous offices alongside the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3221/\">Victualling Board</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/\">Tower Hill</a>, with its brewhouse and abattoir. The newly acquired premises had originally been a large house built on the site of the old Crutched Friars monastery after the Suppression in 1538. The property was known as Lord Lumley's House and benefited from the original gardens. The Navy Office owned the gardens and the larger part of the house, taxed on 48 hearths in 1666, while a smaller but still substantial part (18 hearths) to the south belonged to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/\">Sir Richard Ford</a>, a wealthy merchant who traded with the Navy Office and became <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1522/\">Lord Mayor of London</a> in 1670. Pepys was instrumental in negotiating with Ford for the Navy Office to take over his part (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/08/20/\">20th August 1661</a>) and refers to the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8052/\">Prize Office</a> using it on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/01/25/\">25th January 1665</a>, however given the Hearth Tax records, it seems to have remained in Ford's hands. </p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/04/25/\">25th April 1666</a>, Samuel, Elizabeth and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/\">Mercer</a> were enjoying the air on the leads \"by our bedchamber\" where they had recently made a little balcony with a bench and railing. From this point they were able to chat with their friend <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8438/\">Mary Batelier</a>. The Bateliers lived on the north side of Crutched Friars (Latham and Matthews edition of the diary, vii p. 117 note 1) which suggests that Pepys' house was on the North side of the Navy Office site.</p>\n\n<p>The original mansion had extensive gardens reaching to the north-west boundary of the site with a backyard behind the Office and foreyard in front. The gate onto Seething Lane was manned by Griffith the caretaker.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/10/\">10th July 1666</a> there was a noisy demonstration by the 300 (or more) wives of unpaid seamen being held prisoner in Holland. When they moved into the foreyard, Sam was able to slip into the office, so he must have lived to the rear of the office with a convenient entrance. The women later got into the garden at the back of the office and came to his window to press their case. There was a further entrance to the site on Tower Hill, \"the merchants' gate\" or servants' entrance, which Sam once used when he was avoiding the bailiffs (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/02/23/\">23rd February 1663</a>). The Pepys' parlour window looked out onto the garden. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/05/23/\">23rd May 1667</a> Sam was afraid of being spotted in a compromising position with the wife of a colleague, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9099/\">Mrs Daniel</a>, \"lest they might espy nous through some trees\".</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-rooms\">Rooms</h3>\n\n<p>It is difficult to be certain about the exact layout of Pepys' house because the diary is not explicit on this point and also because from the moment he gained tenancy, Sam undertook an energetic programme of alteration and interior decoration. Many rooms were redecorated and refurnished repeatedly and Sam used different names for the same room as its use and decor evolved. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER.</strong> The clearest indication comes in the entry for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/03/02/\">2nd March 1669</a> when Sam held the only major house party of the diary period. A large family gathering descended upon Seething Lane for one night only and Sam lists the various sleeping arrangements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/247/\">Pepys</a> and his wife in our blue chamber </li>\n<li>Cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/121/\">Turner</a>, her sister and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/120/\">The.</a> in our best chamber</li>\n<li>Bab., Betty and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8086/\">Betty Turner</a> in our own chamber</li>\n<li>Myself and my wife in the maid's bed which is very good</li>\n<li>Our maids in the coachman's bed</li>\n<li>The coachman with the boy in his settle bed</li>\n<li>And <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/\">Tom</a> where he uses to lie (in a little room off the Hall?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is helpful in that it definitively lists all the sleeping chambers.  In addition we know that on the ground floor there was a kitchen, an entrance hall (lit by pewter wall sconces), and a parlour. The parlour had green curtains and was gilded. (On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/09/27/\">27th September 1662</a> the partition was pulled down between the entrance hall and the boy's room; \"it do make my coming in very handsome\". There is no record of how the boy felt about his loss of privacy).</p>\n\n<p>A new staircase went up to the first floor where there was the most important public room of the house, a sumptuously decorated and furnished dining room. This room came to symbolise Pepys' meteoric rise in wealth and status during the diary period. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/16/\">16th October 1662</a> a fine chimney piece was added and the room was wainscoted.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/31/\">31st October</a> it was refloored and it was repainted on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/11/05/\">5th November</a>. The room was first used as a dining room on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/12/07/\">7th December</a> in time for Christmas. Thereafter a new dining table was bought on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/08/\">8th January 1663</a> and \"fine pictures\" hung. An expensive, probably silver-framed looking-glass was hung on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/12/17/\">17th December 1664</a> together with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/\">Hayles'</a> portraits of Samuel and Elizabeth. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/04/08/\">8th April 1667</a> Pepys had a party of 12 to dinner, all eating off fine <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/\">plate</a>. In July 1668 after being taken on a tour of the newly refurbished royal apartments at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/\">Whitehall</a>, he returned with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5547/\">Simpson</a> the joiner to show him the overmantel as he wanted one in a similar style for himself. <strong>SPOILER</strong> By 22nd January 1669, he was employing the famous landscape artist Dankaerts to paint four panels representing the four houses of the King: Whitehall, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1765/\">Hampton Court</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4068/\">Greenwich</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8842/\">Windsor</a>. (Hampton Court was later replaced by a vista of Rome) This was the day before a dinner party (see below) and Samuel must have relished the opportunity to tell his illustrious guests about the plan.</p>\n\n<p>Samuel retained his own closet and chamber on this floor. His closet had the green hangings from the old dining room. Mouldings were added on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/08/21/\">21st August 1663</a> and a new floor put in on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/08/24/\">24th August</a>. The door was moved on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/05/11/\">11th May 1664</a> and the first two book presses, made by Mr Simpson the Navy joiner, were set up on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/\">23rd July 1666</a>. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/\">Will Hewer's</a> room was also on this floor and when he moved out Samuel initially used it as a wardrobe (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/10/16/\">16th October 1663</a>) and then later had it redecorated for use as a music room, retaining the bed and thus it became their \"best chamber\".</p>\n\n<p>On the new second floor was the Pepys' (Elizabeth's) own bedroom and closet. When the new storey was added, Samuel moved his wife's chamber and closet upstairs and this became the red chamber. New, blue hangings were put up on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/01/10/\">10th January 1666</a>. Elizabeth's closet had a chimney piece installed on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/09/29/\">29th September 1663</a> and was repainted <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/10/01/\">two days later</a>. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/03/11/\">11th April 1666</a>, a rail was set up on the leads to make a balcony and a seat installed. The Pepys' sat out there on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/04/25/\">25th April</a>, talking across Crutched Friars with their neighbour Mary Batelier. There was a maids' room next to the Pepys' bedroom (from which he first observed <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/\">the Fire</a> in 1666) and a room for Elizabeth's personal maid which on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/11/26/\">26th November 1662</a> acquired red hangings.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-cellar\">Cellars</h3>\n\n<p>There were extensive cellars beneath the house, some of which could be locked up and where the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/\">wine</a> was kept.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/03/03/\">3rd March 1663</a> Sam \"broached a tierce of claret\". (A tierce is 42 gallons, one third of a \"pipe\" of 126 gallons). On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/06/02/\">2nd June</a> he found the door unlocked and half the wine gone -- the servants! In spite of the new window he had installed, he still needed to take a candle with him to search for his boy to give him a beating for not doing his homework.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/07/27/\">27th July 1664</a> the Navy colliers delivered a \"great store of coals\"; 10 <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7747/\">chaldron</a> (about 13 tons) which gives some idea of the extent of these cellars. When The Fire broke out in London, Sam was keen to clear all the old lumber out of the cellar to reduce the fire risk and to make more room for storage should it be necessary. (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/10/\">10th September 1666</a>.) The following day he got help to move \"all my chests and money into the further cellar\" After the fire he had a new stairway built from the cellar to the yard (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/21/\">21st September</a>), presumably to make it easier to evacuate in case of emergency.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-books\">Books</h3>\n\n<p>Samuel Pepys was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable collector of books for most of his adult life and his bequest to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/419/\">Magdalene College</a> Cambridge is world famous. The Pepys Library consists of over 3000 books, beautifully bound and arranged by size in 12 stately bookcases. His position at the Navy Office gave him access to the excellent craftsmen who were employed by the Navy. Among other work, Thomas Simpson, master-joiner at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/\">Deptford</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/\">Woolwich</a> yards, was responsible for constructing the first two exquisite book presses which are now in the Pepys Library along with ten further matching examples. He came to Seething Lane on the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/\">23rd July 1666</a> and spent some time with Samuel working on the design; by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/24/\">24th August</a> two presses were installed in the new purple closet. The books were gilded on the spines to add to the aesthetic effect of the matching bindings. The work was interrupted by the Fire and Pepys spent some anxious days mourning a lost crate of books, however they were subsequently found and on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/28/\">28th September</a> the presses were glazed and the newly gilded books installed. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/01/18/\">18th January 1665</a> he had had his old books rebound so that all would be of the same binding. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/12/25/\">Christmas Day 1666</a>, he and his brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/\">Tom</a> spent the afternoon making an alphabetical list of his books. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/11/11/\">11th November 1667</a> Pepys was sorry to hear of the death of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/\">Kirton</a> his old bookseller, \"of grief for his losses by the fire\". The booksellers of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/182/\">St Paul's churchyard</a>, seeing the fire coming their way, had removed their stock into <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10394/\">St Faith's</a> in the undercroft of St Paul's. Sadly, and here we see devastatingly for Kirton at least, the fire was so intense that the floor of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/\">St Paul's</a> collapsed and all was lost.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-dining\">Fine dining</h3>\n\n<p>Pepys and his wife used their new dining room for the first time on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/12/07/\">7th December 1662</a>. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/06/\">6th January 1663</a> he spent 50 shillings on a new dining table and organised a dinner party for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/13/\">13th January</a>, inviting <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/770/\">Dr Clarke</a> (friend and royal physician), <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1153/\">his wife</a> and sister and a \"she-cousin\", also <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/\">Mr Pierce</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/\">his wife</a>.  Eight for dinner in all, three men and five women (the new table would seat up to ten). Elizabeth was up at 5am to get to market and a <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1705/\">chine</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/381/\">beef</a> was delivered by 6am and roasted on a jack. A cook was drafted in to help. They had <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/\">oysters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1270/\">rabbit</a> hash, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1081/\">lamb</a> as well as the beef, then 30 shillings' worth of roasted fowls, a tart and fruit and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/\">cheese</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The downstairs room was heated with a good fire to welcome the guests then they went up to the fine new dining room, with Samyel's and Elizabeth's chambers serving as withdrawing rooms for the gentlemen and ladies respectively, after dinner. Unfortunately the gentlemen as well as the ladies had to withdraw after dinner because the fire in the new room smoked. (Pepys ruefully notes that this could have been cured by burning charcoal but they didn't have any; no doubt this was conveyed to Elizabeth at the time.) <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/\">Cards</a> were played in the afternoon and then supper (the cold meat) and a sack <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5693/\">posset</a> before the guests left at 10pm. The whole affair cost nearly &pound;5.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/11/14/\">14th November 1666</a> he was planning to hold another, more stately dinner party for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/113/\">Lord Hinchingbroke</a>. This time he began by buying a case of knives, some new glasses and by employing some bricklayers to come round the day before and fix the smoking chimney. They didn't finish until midnight (picture the scene with an impatient Samuel standing over them) and then after all this effort, sadly his lordship was not well enough to attend.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1668/07/19/\">19th July 1668</a> he invited the talented miniaturist, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3691/\">Samuel Cooper</a>, John Hayles the portraitist, the actor <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6533/\">Henry Harris</a>, poet and satirist <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12717/\">Samuel Butler</a> who as Sam says, wrote <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5746/\">\"Hudibras\"</a> and the optical lens manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/574/\">Richard Reeve</a>. This was a stellar group of artists and it is disappointing that not only are we not told what was eaten on this occasion but neither does Samuel record any of the conversation.  That he could gather together such eminent company under his roof is surely a reflection of his own growing reputation as a connoisseur of the arts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER</strong> On 23rd January 1669 the Pepys held the grandest dinner of the diary years. Guests were <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Lord Sandwich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/\">Peterborough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4030/\">Sir Charles Harbord</a>, Lord Hinchingbroke, Mr Sidney and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12097/\">Sir William Godolphin</a>. The day before, a caterer arrived to lay the cloth and fold the napkins. Sam toyed with the idea of having him give lessons in napkin-folding to Elizabeth. The food was professionally catered with \"six or eight dishes, as noble as any man need to have\" and excellent wines. The meal \"was done in the noblest manner that ever I had any, and rarely have seen in my life better anywhere else, even at court\" After dinner there were cards and conversation; Samuel showed off his books and pictures as well as his (absent) wife's drawings.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-plumbing\">And finally, the plumbing!</h3>\n\n<p>Although there were no foul water drains in Pepys' time, there were bye-laws governing the management of human waste in London. Every house had to have a cess pit, linked to the \"house of office\" by a chute, usually made of wood and concealed within the walls of the house and emptied by \"night soil\" men who worked during the hours of darkness. The proceeds of their collection were sold to farmers as fertiliser.  When Mr Turner failed to have his cess pit emptied it overflowed into Sam's cellar, as we have seen.</p>\n\n<p>There was apparently some kind of running water supply in the better houses on the site but the pressure was unreliable. Elizabeth annoyed <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/\">Lady Batten</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/03/10/\">10th March 1663</a> by sending her boy <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1248/\">Wayneman</a> to turn off the stop cock to the Battens' house so that she could have a more copious supply to do the washing. Sam had to smooth it all over later, saying that it was his wife's fault. Griffith the doorman had to make do with a pump in the yard. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/08/21/\">21st August 1664</a> Samuel was alarmed at the sight of people coming to fetch water; was there a fire? No it was just Griffith's maid fetching water. </p>\n\n<p>Bathrooms had yet to be invented and washing of the body is rarely mentioned in the diary with one notable exception. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/02/21/\">21st February 1665</a>, Elizabeth visited a \"hot-house\" (Turkish Bath). Sam ruefully noted \"how long it will hold I can guess\". The following night she would not let Sam sleep with her and he complained of being cold, alone in his bed. The following night he gave in and \"cleaned himself with warm water, my wife will have me because she do herself, and so to bed\". Elizabeth had made her point and bathing was never mentioned again.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-end\">The end of Samuel's Navy Office</h3>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER</strong>There is a print in the Guildhall Library of the new Navy Office \"on Crutched Friars\". This was the building designed by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9711/\">Wren</a> to replace the building which Samuel would have known on that site and which burned down on 29th January 1673.  A fire started in the early hours of the morning and resulted in the entire site being burned to the ground. As always Sam must have acted quickly and decisively in saving his precious books and bookcases as they can still  be seen today at the Pepys Library in Cambridge. The Ogilby and Morgan map of 1676 shows an empty site before rebuilding was completed and this is the clearest evidence we have for where the old building stood. The new Navy Office finally opened in 1683. </p>\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n<p>Quotations come from Pepys' Diary, 1893, edited by Henry B.

            "intro": "<p><strong>Sue Nicholson</strong></p>\n\n<p>Samuel Pepys was anxious. He had been promised a house to go with his new job at the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/\">Navy Office</a>, at the extraordinary salary of &pound;350 per annum. The newly restored Monarchy meant a complete changeover of staff in all areas of the administration. The Commonwealth mandarins were being superseded by the King's Men and Samuel Pepys, having played an active role in returning <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">Charles</a> to the throne alongside his cousin and patron <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Sir Edward Mountagu</a>, was rewarded with the position of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/484/\">Clerk of the Acts</a>.</p>", 
            "text_html": "<p>When he went for an initial look round on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/07/04/\">4th July 1660</a>, he could barely contain his excitement. The houses belonging to the Navy Office on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6920/\">Seething Lane</a> all looked very attractive (\"the worst very good\") and his first thought was that he risked being \"shuffled out\" by the older, more powerful men he was working alongside. It would be a huge step up from his current <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/102/\">\"little house\"</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6919/\">Axe Yard</a>, in the sprawling complex of Westminster.  When just a week later he noticed a \"busy fellow come to look out the best lodgings for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/\">Lord Berkely</a>\", he acted quickly and decisively. He finished the business of the day and then rushed home to Axe Yard, gathered up a pair of sheets and hurried to the Navy Office, where he boldly knocked on the door of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/637/\">Commissioner Willoughby's</a> house, to which he had taken a fancy, and invited himself in for the night. \"where I was received by him very civilly and slept well\". </p>\n\n<p>Two days later he took <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/\">his wife</a> to see <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/\">\"my house\"</a> and records that they were both \"mightily pleased\". They moved in on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/07/17/\">17th July</a>, by which time Sam had already got the Navy carpenters to create a door out of their chamber onto the flat, leaded roof space (\"<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1262/\">the leads</a>\"); he was looking forward to airing himself on the roof, with a view over the Navy Office site with its extensive gardens. </p>\n\n<p>No time was wasted in ordering further improvements. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/09/06/\">6th September</a> the joiners were in, putting a new floor in the dining room, on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/09/25/\">25th</a> there were plasterers in all the rooms and by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/04/\">4th October</a> the painters were busy. Elizabeth bought a new bed and furniture for her chamber. On the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/09/\">9th</a> the upholsterer was putting up new hangings in Elizabeth's chamber and on the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/13/\">13th</a> Pepys set up his bookshelves in his study/closet. By <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/19/\">19th October</a>, the ground floor dining room was finished with green serge hangings and \"gilt leather\" (leather with a gilded and coloured embossed pattern) on the walls.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Young Sam's instincts in claiming a house for himself were well-founded. Powerful and experienced men were also moving in all around him and there was a certain amount of jostling. Sam found that another, more senior neighbour <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/\">Sir William Batten</a> had \"stopped up\" one of his cellar windows and he called the carpenters in to create a new one. Sadly \"going down into my cellar to look, I put my foot into a great heap of ..., by which I find <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/\">Mr Turner's</a> <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1387/\">house of office</a> is full and comes into my cellar\". Thomas Turner was a senior clerk at the Navy Office. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/10/29/\">29th October</a> <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1528/\">Sir John Davis</a>, Lord Berkeley's Clerk, and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1526/\">his wife</a> moved in next door. Their first action was to wait until Sam was out at work and then to send their servants in to break down his chamber door and block up the newly made door onto the leads, which Sam had apparently done without permission. The comptroller <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1269/\">Sir Robert Slingsby</a> didn't side with the young Pepys, saying only that he didn't want to offend Lady Davis. Things got worse; on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/11/12/\">12th November</a>, foul water started coming into the parlour under the wall adjoining the Davis' house. Presumably whatever had caused the leak was repaired because on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/12/17/\">17th December</a> Sam happily recorded that \"this day my parlour is gilded\", in time for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/314/\">Christmas</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Come the Spring and a new staircase was being constructed, going up from the parlour. It may have been intricately carved as Sam later submitted a bill on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/09/01/\">1st September 1663</a> for 21<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for all the \"carved work\" he had installed, which the Navy kindly paid. The diary records that he was delighted but also guilty for this \"vanity\". While the new staircase was being installed on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/03/27/\">27th March 1661</a>, it had to be temporarily replaced with a ladder; Elizabeth stayed up in her room all day. </p>\n\n<p>Finally a new coat of paint was applied to the whole house and on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/06/21/\">21st June 1661</a>, there were new green curtains in the parlour and the painters had finished at last.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1662/06/\">June 1662</a>, Navy joiners built the wooden frames to create a third storey for Pepys' and Batten's houses. This work took several months, including a time when Sam had to remove his belongings to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/\">Sir William Penn's</a> house (Penn was away) and then when Penn returned unexpectedly, had to rely on the good offices of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/\">Griffith</a> the caretaker to find him alternative lodgings. A junior clerk was persuaded by Griffith to move out of his rooms on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/\">Tower Hill</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/08/30/\">30th August</a>, \"he do provide himself elsewhere and I am to have his chamber\". </p>\n\n<p>Pepys soon found himself with another new neighbour. The Davises moved with Lord Berkeley to Ireland and their lodgings, above the Turners, were taken over by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/\">Sir John Mennes</a>. He was soon complaining that the new storey had blocked the light onto his stairway and access to his house of office on the leads (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/09/08/\">8 September 1662</a>). Pepys thought he had reassured him but a few days later Mennes took <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/\">Sir William Coventry</a> with Pepys to look at how the building work had \"blinded all his lights and stopped up his garden door\". He was also outraged that one of Pepys' servants had been looking in at his window.</p>\n\n<p>The major worry for Pepys at this time was that Mennes might revenge himself by claiming the first floor \"best chamber\" as part of his own lodgings. The plasterer and bricklayer who had created the original dividing walls reassured him that the room belonged to his part of the property but he worried about it in his diary for weeks to come.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-location\">Location and layout</h3>\n\n<p>The Navy Office site was acquired initially by the Commonwealth Government for the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/\">Navy Board</a> in 1654 from John Wolstenholme who had suffered a financial reversal. It was bounded on the west by Seething Lane (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/04/29/\">29th April 1667</a> Pepys went out into \"our Lane\" to observe a fire in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1284/\">Southwark</a>) and to the North by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10032/\">Crutched Friars</a> and Hart St (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/05/09/\">9th Septmber 1667</a> \"our Street\" is where the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10546/\">Three Tuns Tavern</a> was, where two brothers fought and one was killed.)</p>\n\n<p>At the time the Navy Board must have been relieved to get away from their previous offices alongside the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3221/\">Victualling Board</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/\">Tower Hill</a>, with its brewhouse and abattoir. The newly acquired premises had originally been a large house built on the site of the old Crutched Friars monastery after the Suppression in 1538. The property was known as Lord Lumley's House and benefited from the original gardens. The Navy Office owned the gardens and the larger part of the house, taxed on 48 hearths in 1666, while a smaller but still substantial part (18 hearths) to the south belonged to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/\">Sir Richard Ford</a>, a wealthy merchant who traded with the Navy Office and became <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1522/\">Lord Mayor of London</a> in 1670. Pepys was instrumental in negotiating with Ford for the Navy Office to take over his part (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/08/20/\">20th August 1661</a>) and refers to the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8052/\">Prize Office</a> using it on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/01/25/\">25th January 1665</a>, however given the Hearth Tax records, it seems to have remained in Ford's hands. </p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/04/25/\">25th April 1666</a>, Samuel, Elizabeth and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/\">Mercer</a> were enjoying the air on the leads \"by our bedchamber\" where they had recently made a little balcony with a bench and railing. From this point they were able to chat with their friend <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8438/\">Mary Batelier</a>. The Bateliers lived on the north side of Crutched Friars (Latham and Matthews edition of the diary, vii p. 117 note 1) which suggests that Pepys' house was on the North side of the Navy Office site.</p>\n\n<p>The original mansion had extensive gardens reaching to the north-west boundary of the site with a backyard behind the Office and foreyard in front. The gate onto Seething Lane was manned by Griffith the caretaker.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/10/\">10th July 1666</a> there was a noisy demonstration by the 300 (or more) wives of unpaid seamen being held prisoner in Holland. When they moved into the foreyard, Sam was able to slip into the office, so he must have lived to the rear of the office with a convenient entrance. The women later got into the garden at the back of the office and came to his window to press their case. There was a further entrance to the site on Tower Hill, \"the merchants' gate\" or servants' entrance, which Sam once used when he was avoiding the bailiffs (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/02/23/\">23rd February 1663</a>). The Pepys' parlour window looked out onto the garden. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/05/23/\">23rd May 1667</a> Sam was afraid of being spotted in a compromising position with the wife of a colleague, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9099/\">Mrs Daniel</a>, \"lest they might espy nous through some trees\".</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-rooms\">Rooms</h3>\n\n<p>It is difficult to be certain about the exact layout of Pepys' house because the diary is not explicit on this point and also because from the moment he gained tenancy, Sam undertook an energetic programme of alteration and interior decoration. Many rooms were redecorated and refurnished repeatedly and Sam used different names for the same room as its use and decor evolved. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER.</strong> The clearest indication comes in the entry for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/03/02/\">2nd March 1669</a> when Sam held the only major house party of the diary period. A large family gathering descended upon Seething Lane for one night only and Sam lists the various sleeping arrangements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/247/\">Pepys</a> and his wife in our blue chamber </li>\n<li>Cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/121/\">Turner</a>, her sister and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/120/\">The.</a> in our best chamber</li>\n<li>Bab., Betty and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8086/\">Betty Turner</a> in our own chamber</li>\n<li>Myself and my wife in the maid's bed which is very good</li>\n<li>Our maids in the coachman's bed</li>\n<li>The coachman with the boy in his settle bed</li>\n<li>And <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/\">Tom</a> where he uses to lie (in a little room off the Hall?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is helpful in that it definitively lists all the sleeping chambers.  In addition we know that on the ground floor there was a kitchen, an entrance hall (lit by pewter wall sconces), and a parlour. The parlour had green curtains and was gilded. (On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/09/27/\">27th September 1662</a> the partition was pulled down between the entrance hall and the boy's room; \"it do make my coming in very handsome\". There is no record of how the boy felt about his loss of privacy).</p>\n\n<p>A new staircase went up to the first floor where there was the most important public room of the house, a sumptuously decorated and furnished dining room. This room came to symbolise Pepys' meteoric rise in wealth and status during the diary period. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/16/\">16th October 1662</a> a fine chimney piece was added and the room was wainscoted.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/31/\">31st October</a> it was refloored and it was repainted on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/11/05/\">5th November</a>. The room was first used as a dining room on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/12/07/\">7th December</a> in time for Christmas. Thereafter a new dining table was bought on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/08/\">8th January 1663</a> and \"fine pictures\" hung. An expensive, probably silver-framed looking-glass was hung on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/12/17/\">17th December 1664</a> together with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/\">Hayles'</a> portraits of Samuel and Elizabeth. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/04/08/\">8th April 1667</a> Pepys had a party of 12 to dinner, all eating off fine <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/\">plate</a>. In July 1668 after being taken on a tour of the newly refurbished royal apartments at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/\">Whitehall</a>, he returned with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5547/\">Simpson</a> the joiner to show him the overmantel as he wanted one in a similar style for himself. <strong>SPOILER</strong> By 22nd January 1669, he was employing the famous landscape artist Dankaerts to paint four panels representing the four houses of the King: Whitehall, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1765/\">Hampton Court</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4068/\">Greenwich</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8842/\">Windsor</a>. (Hampton Court was later replaced by a vista of Rome) This was the day before a dinner party (see below) and Samuel must have relished the opportunity to tell his illustrious guests about the plan.</p>\n\n<p>Samuel retained his own closet and chamber on this floor. His closet had the green hangings from the old dining room. Mouldings were added on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/08/21/\">21st August 1663</a> and a new floor put in on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/08/24/\">24th August</a>. The door was moved on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/05/11/\">11th May 1664</a> and the first two book presses, made by Mr Simpson the Navy joiner, were set up on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/\">23rd July 1666</a>. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/\">Will Hewer's</a> room was also on this floor and when he moved out Samuel initially used it as a wardrobe (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/10/16/\">16th October 1663</a>) and then later had it redecorated for use as a music room, retaining the bed and thus it became their \"best chamber\".</p>\n\n<p>On the new second floor was the Pepys' (Elizabeth's) own bedroom and closet. When the new storey was added, Samuel moved his wife's chamber and closet upstairs and this became the red chamber. New, blue hangings were put up on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/01/10/\">10th January 1666</a>. Elizabeth's closet had a chimney piece installed on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/09/29/\">29th September 1663</a> and was repainted <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/10/01/\">two days later</a>. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/03/11/\">11th April 1666</a>, a rail was set up on the leads to make a balcony and a seat installed. The Pepys' sat out there on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/04/25/\">25th April</a>, talking across Crutched Friars with their neighbour Mary Batelier. There was a maids' room next to the Pepys' bedroom (from which he first observed <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/\">the Fire</a> in 1666) and a room for Elizabeth's personal maid which on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/11/26/\">26th November 1662</a> acquired red hangings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-cellar\">Cellars</h3>\n\n<p>There were extensive cellars beneath the house, some of which could be locked up and where the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/\">wine</a> was kept.  On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/03/03/\">3rd March 1663</a> Sam \"broached a tierce of claret\". (A tierce is 42 gallons, one third of a \"pipe\" of 126 gallons). On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/06/02/\">2nd June</a> he found the door unlocked and half the wine gone -- the servants! In spite of the new window he had installed, he still needed to take a candle with him to search for his boy to give him a beating for not doing his homework.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/07/27/\">27th July 1664</a> the Navy colliers delivered a \"great store of coals\"; 10 <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7747/\">chaldron</a> (about 13 tons) which gives some idea of the extent of these cellars. When The Fire broke out in London, Sam was keen to clear all the old lumber out of the cellar to reduce the fire risk and to make more room for storage should it be necessary. (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/10/\">10th September 1666</a>.) The following day he got help to move \"all my chests and money into the further cellar\" After the fire he had a new stairway built from the cellar to the yard (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/21/\">21st September</a>), presumably to make it easier to evacuate in case of emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-books\">Books</h3>\n\n<p>Samuel Pepys was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable collector of books for most of his adult life and his bequest to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/419/\">Magdalene College</a> Cambridge is world famous. The Pepys Library consists of over 3000 books, beautifully bound and arranged by size in 12 stately bookcases. His position at the Navy Office gave him access to the excellent craftsmen who were employed by the Navy. Among other work, Thomas Simpson, master-joiner at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/\">Deptford</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/\">Woolwich</a> yards, was responsible for constructing the first two exquisite book presses which are now in the Pepys Library along with ten further matching examples. He came to Seething Lane on the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/\">23rd July 1666</a> and spent some time with Samuel working on the design; by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/24/\">24th August</a> two presses were installed in the new purple closet. The books were gilded on the spines to add to the aesthetic effect of the matching bindings. The work was interrupted by the Fire and Pepys spent some anxious days mourning a lost crate of books, however they were subsequently found and on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/28/\">28th September</a> the presses were glazed and the newly gilded books installed. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/01/18/\">18th January 1665</a> he had had his old books rebound so that all would be of the same binding. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/12/25/\">Christmas Day 1666</a>, he and his brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/\">Tom</a> spent the afternoon making an alphabetical list of his books. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/11/11/\">11th November 1667</a> Pepys was sorry to hear of the death of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/\">Kirton</a> his old bookseller, \"of grief for his losses by the fire\". The booksellers of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/182/\">St Paul's churchyard</a>, seeing the fire coming their way, had removed their stock into <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10394/\">St Faith's</a> in the undercroft of St Paul's. Sadly, and here we see devastatingly for Kirton at least, the fire was so intense that the floor of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/\">St Paul's</a> collapsed and all was lost.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-dining\">Fine dining</h3>\n\n<p>Pepys and his wife used their new dining room for the first time on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/12/07/\">7th December 1662</a>. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/06/\">6th January 1663</a> he spent 50 shillings on a new dining table and organised a dinner party for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/13/\">13th January</a>, inviting <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/770/\">Dr Clarke</a> (friend and royal physician), <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1153/\">his wife</a> and sister and a \"she-cousin\", also <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/\">Mr Pierce</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/\">his wife</a>.  Eight for dinner in all, three men and five women (the new table would seat up to ten). Elizabeth was up at 5am to get to market and a <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1705/\">chine</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/381/\">beef</a> was delivered by 6am and roasted on a jack. A cook was drafted in to help. They had <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/\">oysters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1270/\">rabbit</a> hash, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1081/\">lamb</a> as well as the beef, then 30 shillings' worth of roasted fowls, a tart and fruit and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/\">cheese</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The downstairs room was heated with a good fire to welcome the guests then they went up to the fine new dining room, with Samyel's and Elizabeth's chambers serving as withdrawing rooms for the gentlemen and ladies respectively, after dinner. Unfortunately the gentlemen as well as the ladies had to withdraw after dinner because the fire in the new room smoked. (Pepys ruefully notes that this could have been cured by burning charcoal but they didn't have any; no doubt this was conveyed to Elizabeth at the time.) <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/\">Cards</a> were played in the afternoon and then supper (the cold meat) and a sack <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5693/\">posset</a> before the guests left at 10pm. The whole affair cost nearly &pound;5.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/11/14/\">14th November 1666</a> he was planning to hold another, more stately dinner party for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/113/\">Lord Hinchingbroke</a>. This time he began by buying a case of knives, some new glasses and by employing some bricklayers to come round the day before and fix the smoking chimney. They didn't finish until midnight (picture the scene with an impatient Samuel standing over them) and then after all this effort, sadly his lordship was not well enough to attend.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1668/07/19/\">19th July 1668</a> he invited the talented miniaturist, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3691/\">Samuel Cooper</a>, John Hayles the portraitist, the actor <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6533/\">Henry Harris</a>, poet and satirist <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12717/\">Samuel Butler</a> who as Sam says, wrote <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5746/\">\"Hudibras\"</a> and the optical lens manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/574/\">Richard Reeve</a>. This was a stellar group of artists and it is disappointing that not only are we not told what was eaten on this occasion but neither does Samuel record any of the conversation.  That he could gather together such eminent company under his roof is surely a reflection of his own growing reputation as a connoisseur of the arts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER</strong> On 23rd January 1669 the Pepys held the grandest dinner of the diary years. Guests were <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Lord Sandwich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/\">Peterborough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4030/\">Sir Charles Harbord</a>, Lord Hinchingbroke, Mr Sidney and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12097/\">Sir William Godolphin</a>. The day before, a caterer arrived to lay the cloth and fold the napkins. Sam toyed with the idea of having him give lessons in napkin-folding to Elizabeth. The food was professionally catered with \"six or eight dishes, as noble as any man need to have\" and excellent wines. The meal \"was done in the noblest manner that ever I had any, and rarely have seen in my life better anywhere else, even at court\" After dinner there were cards and conversation; Samuel showed off his books and pictures as well as his (absent) wife's drawings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-plumbing\">And finally, the plumbing!</h3>\n\n<p>Although there were no foul water drains in Pepys' time, there were bye-laws governing the management of human waste in London. Every house had to have a cess pit, linked to the \"house of office\" by a chute, usually made of wood and concealed within the walls of the house and emptied by \"night soil\" men who worked during the hours of darkness. The proceeds of their collection were sold to farmers as fertiliser.  When Mr Turner failed to have his cess pit emptied it overflowed into Sam's cellar, as we have seen.</p>\n\n<p>There was apparently some kind of running water supply in the better houses on the site but the pressure was unreliable. Elizabeth annoyed <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/\">Lady Batten</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/03/10/\">10th March 1663</a> by sending her boy <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1248/\">Wayneman</a> to turn off the stop cock to the Battens' house so that she could have a more copious supply to do the washing. Sam had to smooth it all over later, saying that it was his wife's fault. Griffith the doorman had to make do with a pump in the yard. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/08/21/\">21st August 1664</a> Samuel was alarmed at the sight of people coming to fetch water; was there a fire? No it was just Griffith's maid fetching water. </p>\n\n<p>Bathrooms had yet to be invented and washing of the body is rarely mentioned in the diary with one notable exception. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/02/21/\">21st February 1665</a>, Elizabeth visited a \"hot-house\" (Turkish Bath). Sam ruefully noted \"how long it will hold I can guess\". The following night she would not let Sam sleep with her and he complained of being cold, alone in his bed. The following night he gave in and \"cleaned himself with warm water, my wife will have me because she do herself, and so to bed\". Elizabeth had made her point and bathing was never mentioned again.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"h-end\">The end of Samuel's Navy Office</h3>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER</strong>There is a print in the Guildhall Library of the new Navy Office \"on Crutched Friars\". This was the building designed by <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9711/\">Wren</a> to replace the building which Samuel would have known on that site and which burned down on 29th January 1673.  A fire started in the early hours of the morning and resulted in the entire site being burned to the ground. As always Sam must have acted quickly and decisively in saving his precious books and bookcases as they can still  be seen today at the Pepys Library in Cambridge. The Ogilby and Morgan map of 1676 shows an empty site before rebuilding was completed and this is the clearest evidence we have for where the old building stood. The new Navy Office finally opened in 1683. </p>\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Quotations come from Pepys' Diary, 1893, edited by Henry B.

After dinner the fire continuing, with my Wife & Sonn took Coach & went to the bank side in Southwark, where we beheld that dismal speectaccle, the whole Citty in dreadfull flames neere the Water side, & had now consumed all the houses from the bridge all Thames Streete & up-wards towards Cheape side, downe to the three Cranes, & so returned exceedingly astonishd, what would become of the rest. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660902\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660903\">Monday 3 September 1666</h3>\n\nThe Fire having continud all this night (if I may call that night, which was as light as day for 10 miles round about after a dreadfull manner) when consp[ir]ing with a fierce Eastern Wind, in a very drie season, I went on foote to the same place, when I saw the whole South part of the Citty burning from Cheape side to the Thames, & all along Cornehill (for it likewise kindled back against the Wind, as well [as] forward) Tower-Streete, Fen-church-streete, Gracious Streete, & so along to Bainard Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Paules-Church, to which the Scaffalds contributed exceedingly.\n\nThe Conflagration was so universal, & the people so astonish'd, that from the beginning (I know not by what desponding or fate), they hardly stirr'd to quench it, so as there was nothing heard or seene but crying out & lamentation, & running about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation there was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth & length, The Churches, Publique Halls, Exchange, Hospitals, Monuments, & ornaments, leaping after a prodigious manner from house to house & streete to streete, at greate distance one from the other, for the heate (with a long set of faire & warme weather) had even ignited the aire, & prepared the materials to conceive the fire, which devoured after a[n] incredible manner, houses, furniture, & everything. Here we saw the Thames coverd with goods floating, all the barges & boates laden with what some had time & courage to save, as on the other, the Carts &c carrying out to the fields, which for many miles were strewed with moveables of all sorts, & Tents erecting to shelter both people & what goods they could get away. o the miserable & calamitous speectacle, such as happly the whole world had not seene the like since the foundation of it, nor to be out don, 'til the universal Conflagration of it, all the skie were of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning Oven, & the light seene above 40 miles round about for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like, who now saw above ten thousand houses all in one flame, the noise & crakling & thunder of the impetuous flames, the shreeking of Women & children, the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses & churches was like an hideous storme, & the aire all about so hot & inflam'd that at the last one was not able to approch it, so as they were force'd [to] stand still, and let the flames consume on which they did for neere two whole mile[s] in length and one in bredth. The Clowds also of Smoke were dismall, & reached upon computation neere 50 miles in length.\n\nThus I left it this afternoone burning, a resemblance of Sodome, or the last day. It call'd to mind that of 4 Heb: _non enim hic habemus stabilem Civitatem_; the ruines resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but is no more. Thus I return'd. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660903\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660904\">Tuesday 4 September 1666</h3>\n\nThe burning still rages; I went now on horse back, & it was now gotten as far as the Inner Temple, all Fleetestreete, old baily, Ludgate Hill, Warwick Lane, Newgate, Paules Chaine, Wattling-streete now flaming & most of it reduc'd to ashes, the stones of Paules flew like granados, the Lead mealting down the streetes in a streame, & the very pavements of them glowing with a fiery rednesse, so as nor horse nor man was able to tread on them, & the demolitions had stopped all the passages, so as no help could be applied; the Easter[n] Wind still more impetuously driving the flames forewards. Nothing but the almighty power of God was able to stop them, for vaine was the help of man: on the fift it crossed towards White-hall, but o the Confusion was then at that Court.\n\nIt pleased his Majestie to command me among the rest to looke after the quenching of fetter-lane end, to preserve (if possible) that part of Holborn, whilst the rest of the Gent. tooke their several posts, some at one part, some at another, for now they began to bestirr themselves, & not 'til now, who 'til now had stood as men interdict, with their hands a crosse, & began to consider that nothing was like to put a stop, but the blowing up of so many houses, as might make a [wider] gap, than any had yet ben made by the ordinary method of pulling them downe with Engines. This some stout Seamen proposd early enought to have saved the whole Citty. But some tenacious & avaritious Men, Aldermen &c. would not permitt, because their houses must have ben [of] the first. It was therefore now commanded to be practised, & my conerne being particularly for the Hospital of St. Bartholomeus neere Smithfield, where I had many wounded & sick men, made me the more diligent to promote it; nor was my care for the Savoy lesse. So as it pleased Almighty God by abating of the Wind, & the industrie of people, now when all was lost, infusing a new Spirit into them (& such as had if exerted in time undoubtedly preserved the whole) that the furie of it began sensibly to abate, about noone, so as it came no farther than the Temple West-ward, nor than the enterance of Smithfield North; but continued all this day & night so impetuous toward Cripple-Gate, & The Tower, as made us even all despaire. It also brake out againe in the Temple: but the courage of the multitude persisting, & innumerable houses blown up with Gunpowder, such gaps & desolations were soone made, as also by the former three days consumption, as the back fire did not so vehemently urge upon the rest, as formerly.\n\nThere was yet no standing neere the burning & glowing ruines neere a furlongs Space; The Coale & Wood wharfes & magazines of Oyle, rozine, [chandler] &c. did infinite mischiefe; so as the invective I but a little before dedicated to his Majestie & publish'd, giving warning what might probably be the issue of suffering those shops to be in the Citty, was lookd on as prophetic. But there I left this smoking & sultry heape, which mounted up in dismall clowds night & day, the poore Inhabitans dispersd all about St. Georges, Moore filds, as far as higate, & severall miles in Circle, Some under tents, others under miserab[l]e Hutts and Hovells, without a rag, or any necessary utinsils, bed or board, who from delicatnesse, riches & easy accommodations in stately & well furnishd houses, were now reduc'd to extreamest misery & poverty. In this Calamitous Condition I returnd with a sad heart to my house, blessing & adoring the distinguishing mercy of God, to me & mine, who in the midst of all this ruine, was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe and sound. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660904\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660906\">Thursday 6 September 1666</h3>\n\nThursday, I represented to his Majestie the Case, of the French Prisoners at War in my Custodie, & besought him, there might be still the same care of Watching at all places contiguous to unseized houses. It is not indeede imaginable how extraordinary the vigilanc[e] & activity of the King & Duke was, even labouring in person, & being present, to command, order, reward, and enourage Workemen; by which he shewed his affection to his people, & gained theirs. Having then disposed of some under Cure, at the Savoy, I return'd to white hall, where I dined at Mr. Offleys, Groome-porter, who was my relation, together with the Knight Martial, where I also lay that night. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660906\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660907\">Friday 7 September 1666</h3>\n\nI went this morning on foote from White hall as far as London bridge, thro the Late fleete streete, Ludgate hill, by St. Paules, Cheape side, Exchange, Bishopsgate, Aldersgate, & out to Morefields, thence thro Cornehill, &c. with extraordinary difficulty, clambring over mountaines of yet smoking rubbish, & frequently mistaking where I was, the ground under my feete so hott, as made me not onely Sweate, but even burnt the soles of my shoes, & put me all over in Sweate. In the meane time his Majestie got to the Tower by Water, to demolish the houses about the Graft, which being built intirely about it, had they taken fire, & attaq'd the white Towre, where the Magazines of Powder lay, would undo[u]btedly have not onely beaten downe & destroyed all the bridge, but sunke & torne all the vessells in the river, & rendred the demolition beyond all expression for severall miles even about the Country at many miles distance.\n\nAt my returne I was infinitly concern'd to find that goodly Chur[c]h St. Paules now a sad ruine, & that beautifull Portico (for structure comparable to any in Europ, as not long before repaird by the late King) now rent in pieces, flakes of vast Stone Split in sunder, & nothing remaining intire but the Inscription in the Architrave which shewing by whom it was built, had not one letter of it defac'd: which I could not but take notice of. It was astonishing to see what imense stones the heate had in a manner Calcin'd, so as all the ornaments, Columns, freezes, Capitels & proje[c]tures of massie Portland stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a Sheete of Leade covering no lesse than 6 akers by measure, being totaly mealted, the ruines of the Vaulted roofe, falling brake into St. Faithes, which being filled with the magazines of bookes, belonging to the Stationer[s], & carried thither for safty, they were all consumed burning for a weeke following. It is also observable, that the lead over the Altar at the East end was untouch'd; and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop, remained intire.\n\nThus lay in ashes that most venerab[l]e Church, one of the [antientest] Pieces of early Piety in the Christian world, beside neere 100 more. The lead, yronworke, bells, plate &c mealted; the exquisitely wrought Mercers Chapell, the Sumptuous Exchange, the august fabricque of Christ church, all the rest of the Companies Halls, sumptuous buildings, Arches, Enteries, all in dust. The fountaines dried up & ruind, whilst the very waters remained boiling; the Voragos of subterranean Cellars Wells & Dungeons, formerly Warehouses, still burning in stench & dark clowds of smoke like hell, so as in five or six miles traversing about, I did not see one load of timber unconsum'd, nor many stones but what were calcind white as snow, so as the people who now walked about the ruines, appeard like men in some dismal desart, or rather in some greate Citty, lay'd wast by an impetuous & cruel Enemy, to which was added the stench that came from some poore Creaturs bodys, beds & other combustible goods.\n\nSir Tho. Gresshams Statue, though falln to the ground from its nich in the R. Exchange remain'd intire, when all those of the Kings since the Conquest were broken to pieces. Also the Standard in Cornehill, & Q. Elizabeths Effigies, with some armes on Ludgate continud with but little detriment, whilst the vast yron Chaines of the Cittie streetes, vast hinges, barrs & gates of Prisons were many of them mealted, & reduc'd to cinders by the vehement heats. Nor was I yet able to pass through any of the narrower streetes, but kept [to] the widest, the ground & aire, smoake & fiery vapour, continud so intense, my hair being almost seinged, & my feete unsufferably surbated. The bielanes & narrower streetes were quite fill'd up with rubbish, nor could one have possibly knowne where he was, but by the ruines of some church, or hall, that had some remarkable towre or pinacle remaining.\n\nI then went towards Islington, & high-gate, where one might have seene two hundred thousand people of all ranks & degrees, dispersed, & laying along by their heapes of what they could save from the Incendium, deploring their losse, & though ready to perish for hunger & destitution, yet not asking one penny for reliefe, which to me appeard a stranger sight, than any I had yet beheld. His Majestie & Council indeeade tooke all imaginable care for their reliefe, by Proclamation, for the Country to come in & refresh them with provisions: when in the middst of all this Calamity & confusion, there was (I know not how) an Alarme begun, that the French & Dutch (with whom we were now in hostility) were not onely landed, but even entring the Citty; there being in truth, greate suspicion some days before, of those two nations joyning, & even now, that they had ben the occasion of firing the Towne.\n\nThis report did so terrifie, that on a suddaine there was such an uprore & tumult, that they ran from their goods, Taking what weapons they could come at, they could not be stop'd from falling on some of those nations whom they casualy met, without sense or reason, the clamor & perill growing so excessive, as made the whole Court amaz'd at it, & they did with infinite paines, & greate difficulty reduce & apease the people, sending Guards & troopes of souldiers, to cause them to retire into the fields againe, where they were watched all this night when I left them pretty quiet, & came home to my house, sufficiently weary & broken. Their spirits thus a little sedated, & the affright abated, they now began to repaire into the suburbs about the Citty, where such as had friends or opportunit[i]e got shelter & harbour for the Present; to which his Majesties Proclamation also invited them. Still the Plage, continuing in our parish, I could not without danger adventure to our Church. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660907\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660910\">Monday 10 September 1666</h3>\n\nI went againe to the ruines, for it was now no longer a Citty. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660910\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n\n<h3 id=\"d16660911\">Tuesday 11 September 1666</h3>\n\nSat at Star Chamber, on the 13, I presented his Majestie with a Survey of the ruines, and a Plot for a new Citty, with a discourse on it, whereupon, after dinner, his Majestie sent for me into the Queenes Bed-chamber, her Majestie & the Duke onely present, where they examind each particular, & discoursed upon them for neere a full houre, seeming to be extreamly pleasd with what I had so early thought on. The Queene was now in her Cavaliers riding habite, hat & feather & horsemans Coate, going to take the aire; so I took leave of his Majestie & visiting the Duke of Albemarle, now newly return'd from Sea, I went home. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660911\">Permalink</a>)</small>\n",

After dinner the fire continuing, with my Wife &amp; Sonn took Coach &amp; went to the bank side in Southwark, where we beheld that dismal speectaccle, the whole Citty in dreadfull flames neere the Water side, &amp; had now consumed all the houses from the bridge all Thames Streete &amp; up-wards towards Cheape side, downe to the three Cranes, &amp; so returned exceedingly astonishd, what would become of the rest. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660902\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660903\">Monday 3 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>The Fire having continud all this night (if I may call that night, which was as light as day for 10 miles round about after a dreadfull manner) when consp[ir]ing with a fierce Eastern Wind, in a very drie season, I went on foote to the same place, when I saw the whole South part of the Citty burning from Cheape side to the Thames, &amp; all along Cornehill (for it likewise kindled back against the Wind, as well [as] forward) Tower-Streete, Fen-church-streete, Gracious Streete, &amp; so along to Bainard Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Paules-Church, to which the Scaffalds contributed exceedingly.</p>\n<p>The Conflagration was so universal, &amp; the people so astonish'd, that from the beginning (I know not by what desponding or fate), they hardly stirr'd to quench it, so as there was nothing heard or seene but crying out &amp; lamentation, &amp; running about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation there was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth &amp; length, The Churches, Publique Halls, Exchange, Hospitals, Monuments, &amp; ornaments, leaping after a prodigious manner from house to house &amp; streete to streete, at greate distance one from the other, for the heate (with a long set of faire &amp; warme weather) had even ignited the aire, &amp; prepared the materials to conceive the fire, which devoured after a[n] incredible manner, houses, furniture, &amp; everything. Here we saw the Thames coverd with goods floating, all the barges &amp; boates laden with what some had time &amp; courage to save, as on the other, the Carts &amp;c carrying out to the fields, which for many miles were strewed with moveables of all sorts, &amp; Tents erecting to shelter both people &amp; what goods they could get away. o the miserable &amp; calamitous speectacle, such as happly the whole world had not seene the like since the foundation of it, nor to be out don, 'til the universal Conflagration of it, all the skie were of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning Oven, &amp; the light seene above 40 miles round about for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like, who now saw above ten thousand houses all in one flame, the noise &amp; crakling &amp; thunder of the impetuous flames, the shreeking of Women &amp; children, the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses &amp; churches was like an hideous storme, &amp; the aire all about so hot &amp; inflam'd that at the last one was not able to approch it, so as they were force'd [to] stand still, and let the flames consume on which they did for neere two whole mile[s] in length and one in bredth. The Clowds also of Smoke were dismall, &amp; reached upon computation neere 50 miles in length.</p>\n<p>Thus I left it this afternoone burning, a resemblance of Sodome, or the last day. It call'd to mind that of 4 Heb: <em>non enim hic habemus stabilem Civitatem</em>; the ruines resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but is no more. Thus I return'd. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660903\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660904\">Tuesday 4 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>The burning still rages; I went now on horse back, &amp; it was now gotten as far as the Inner Temple, all Fleetestreete, old baily, Ludgate Hill, Warwick Lane, Newgate, Paules Chaine, Wattling-streete now flaming &amp; most of it reduc'd to ashes, the stones of Paules flew like granados, the Lead mealting down the streetes in a streame, &amp; the very pavements of them glowing with a fiery rednesse, so as nor horse nor man was able to tread on them, &amp; the demolitions had stopped all the passages, so as no help could be applied; the Easter[n] Wind still more impetuously driving the flames forewards. Nothing but the almighty power of God was able to stop them, for vaine was the help of man: on the fift it crossed towards White-hall, but o the Confusion was then at that Court.</p>\n<p>It pleased his Majestie to command me among the rest to looke after the quenching of fetter-lane end, to preserve (if possible) that part of Holborn, whilst the rest of the Gent. tooke their several posts, some at one part, some at another, for now they began to bestirr themselves, &amp; not 'til now, who 'til now had stood as men interdict, with their hands a crosse, &amp; began to consider that nothing was like to put a stop, but the blowing up of so many houses, as might make a [wider] gap, than any had yet ben made by the ordinary method of pulling them downe with Engines. This some stout Seamen proposd early enought to have saved the whole Citty. But some tenacious &amp; avaritious Men, Aldermen &amp;c. would not permitt, because their houses must have ben [of] the first. It was therefore now commanded to be practised, &amp; my conerne being particularly for the Hospital of St. Bartholomeus neere Smithfield, where I had many wounded &amp; sick men, made me the more diligent to promote it; nor was my care for the Savoy lesse. So as it pleased Almighty God by abating of the Wind, &amp; the industrie of people, now when all was lost, infusing a new Spirit into them (&amp; such as had if exerted in time undoubtedly preserved the whole) that the furie of it began sensibly to abate, about noone, so as it came no farther than the Temple West-ward, nor than the enterance of Smithfield North; but continued all this day &amp; night so impetuous toward Cripple-Gate, &amp; The Tower, as made us even all despaire. It also brake out againe in the Temple: but the courage of the multitude persisting, &amp; innumerable houses blown up with Gunpowder, such gaps &amp; desolations were soone made, as also by the former three days consumption, as the back fire did not so vehemently urge upon the rest, as formerly.</p>\n<p>There was yet no standing neere the burning &amp; glowing ruines neere a furlongs Space; The Coale &amp; Wood wharfes &amp; magazines of Oyle, rozine, [chandler] &amp;c. did infinite mischiefe; so as the invective I but a little before dedicated to his Majestie &amp; publish'd, giving warning what might probably be the issue of suffering those shops to be in the Citty, was lookd on as prophetic. But there I left this smoking &amp; sultry heape, which mounted up in dismall clowds night &amp; day, the poore Inhabitans dispersd all about St. Georges, Moore filds, as far as higate, &amp; severall miles in Circle, Some under tents, others under miserab[l]e Hutts and Hovells, without a rag, or any necessary utinsils, bed or board, who from delicatnesse, riches &amp; easy accommodations in stately &amp; well furnishd houses, were now reduc'd to extreamest misery &amp; poverty. In this Calamitous Condition I returnd with a sad heart to my house, blessing &amp; adoring the distinguishing mercy of God, to me &amp; mine, who in the midst of all this ruine, was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe and sound. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660904\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660906\">Thursday 6 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>Thursday, I represented to his Majestie the Case, of the French Prisoners at War in my Custodie, &amp; besought him, there might be still the same care of Watching at all places contiguous to unseized houses. It is not indeede imaginable how extraordinary the vigilanc[e] &amp; activity of the King &amp; Duke was, even labouring in person, &amp; being present, to command, order, reward, and enourage Workemen; by which he shewed his affection to his people, &amp; gained theirs. Having then disposed of some under Cure, at the Savoy, I return'd to white hall, where I dined at Mr. Offleys, Groome-porter, who was my relation, together with the Knight Martial, where I also lay that night. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660906\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660907\">Friday 7 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>I went this morning on foote from White hall as far as London bridge, thro the Late fleete streete, Ludgate hill, by St. Paules, Cheape side, Exchange, Bishopsgate, Aldersgate, &amp; out to Morefields, thence thro Cornehill, &amp;c. with extraordinary difficulty, clambring over mountaines of yet smoking rubbish, &amp; frequently mistaking where I was, the ground under my feete so hott, as made me not onely Sweate, but even burnt the soles of my shoes, &amp; put me all over in Sweate. In the meane time his Majestie got to the Tower by Water, to demolish the houses about the Graft, which being built intirely about it, had they taken fire, &amp; attaq'd the white Towre, where the Magazines of Powder lay, would undo[u]btedly have not onely beaten downe &amp; destroyed all the bridge, but sunke &amp; torne all the vessells in the river, &amp; rendred the demolition beyond all expression for severall miles even about the Country at many miles distance.</p>\n<p>At my returne I was infinitly concern'd to find that goodly Chur[c]h St. Paules now a sad ruine, &amp; that beautifull Portico (for structure comparable to any in Europ, as not long before repaird by the late King) now rent in pieces, flakes of vast Stone Split in sunder, &amp; nothing remaining intire but the Inscription in the Architrave which shewing by whom it was built, had not one letter of it defac'd: which I could not but take notice of. It was astonishing to see what imense stones the heate had in a manner Calcin'd, so as all the ornaments, Columns, freezes, Capitels &amp; proje[c]tures of massie Portland stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a Sheete of Leade covering no lesse than 6 akers by measure, being totaly mealted, the ruines of the Vaulted roofe, falling brake into St. Faithes, which being filled with the magazines of bookes, belonging to the Stationer[s], &amp; carried thither for safty, they were all consumed burning for a weeke following. It is also observable, that the lead over the Altar at the East end was untouch'd; and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop, remained intire.</p>\n<p>Thus lay in ashes that most venerab[l]e Church, one of the [antientest] Pieces of early Piety in the Christian world, beside neere 100 more. The lead, yronworke, bells, plate &amp;c mealted; the exquisitely wrought Mercers Chapell, the Sumptuous Exchange, the august fabricque of Christ church, all the rest of the Companies Halls, sumptuous buildings, Arches, Enteries, all in dust. The fountaines dried up &amp; ruind, whilst the very waters remained boiling; the Voragos of subterranean Cellars Wells &amp; Dungeons, formerly Warehouses, still burning in stench &amp; dark clowds of smoke like hell, so as in five or six miles traversing about, I did not see one load of timber unconsum'd, nor many stones but what were calcind white as snow, so as the people who now walked about the ruines, appeard like men in some dismal desart, or rather in some greate Citty, lay'd wast by an impetuous &amp; cruel Enemy, to which was added the stench that came from some poore Creaturs bodys, beds &amp; other combustible goods.</p>\n<p>Sir Tho. Gresshams Statue, though falln to the ground from its nich in the R. Exchange remain'd intire, when all those of the Kings since the Conquest were broken to pieces. Also the Standard in Cornehill, &amp; Q. Elizabeths Effigies, with some armes on Ludgate continud with but little detriment, whilst the vast yron Chaines of the Cittie streetes, vast hinges, barrs &amp; gates of Prisons were many of them mealted, &amp; reduc'd to cinders by the vehement heats. Nor was I yet able to pass through any of the narrower streetes, but kept [to] the widest, the ground &amp; aire, smoake &amp; fiery vapour, continud so intense, my hair being almost seinged, &amp; my feete unsufferably surbated. The bielanes &amp; narrower streetes were quite fill'd up with rubbish, nor could one have possibly knowne where he was, but by the ruines of some church, or hall, that had some remarkable towre or pinacle remaining.</p>\n<p>I then went towards Islington, &amp; high-gate, where one might have seene two hundred thousand people of all ranks &amp; degrees, dispersed, &amp; laying along by their heapes of what they could save from the Incendium, deploring their losse, &amp; though ready to perish for hunger &amp; destitution, yet not asking one penny for reliefe, which to me appeard a stranger sight, than any I had yet beheld. His Majestie &amp; Council indeeade tooke all imaginable care for their reliefe, by Proclamation, for the Country to come in &amp; refresh them with provisions: when in the middst of all this Calamity &amp; confusion, there was (I know not how) an Alarme begun, that the French &amp; Dutch (with whom we were now in hostility) were not onely landed, but even entring the Citty; there being in truth, greate suspicion some days before, of those two nations joyning, &amp; even now, that they had ben the occasion of firing the Towne.</p>\n<p>This report did so terrifie, that on a suddaine there was such an uprore &amp; tumult, that they ran from their goods, Taking what weapons they could come at, they could not be stop'd from falling on some of those nations whom they casualy met, without sense or reason, the clamor &amp; perill growing so excessive, as made the whole Court amaz'd at it, &amp; they did with infinite paines, &amp; greate difficulty reduce &amp; apease the people, sending Guards &amp; troopes of souldiers, to cause them to retire into the fields againe, where they were watched all this night when I left them pretty quiet, &amp; came home to my house, sufficiently weary &amp; broken. Their spirits thus a little sedated, &amp; the affright abated, they now began to repaire into the suburbs about the Citty, where such as had friends or opportunit[i]e got shelter &amp; harbour for the Present; to which his Majesties Proclamation also invited them. Still the Plage, continuing in our parish, I could not without danger adventure to our Church. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660907\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660910\">Monday 10 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>I went againe to the ruines, for it was now no longer a Citty. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660910\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>\n<h3 id=\"d16660911\">Tuesday 11 September 1666</h3>\n\n<p>Sat at Star Chamber, on the 13, I presented his Majestie with a Survey of the ruines, and a Plot for a new Citty, with a discourse on it, whereupon, after dinner, his Majestie sent for me into the Queenes Bed-chamber, her Majestie &amp; the Duke onely present, where they examind each particular, &amp; discoursed upon them for neere a full houre, seeming to be extreamly pleasd with what I had so early thought on. The Queene was now in her Cavaliers riding habite, hat &amp; feather &amp; horsemans Coate, going to take the aire; so I took leave of his Majestie &amp; visiting the Duke of Albemarle, now newly return'd from Sea, I went home. <small>(<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2009/09/02/evelyns_fire/#d16660911\">Permalink</a>)</small></p>",

            "title": "Evelyn to Pepys, 26 March 1666", 
            "text": "<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\nTo Samuell Pepys, Esqr  \nOne of the principall officers  \nof his Majesties Navy at Navy Office\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Sayes Court<br />\n26 March 1666</p>\n\nSir,\n\nI know not with what successe I have endeavourd to performe your Commands; but it has ben to the uttmost of my skill, of which you are to be my judges: The favour I bespeake of you is, your pardon for not sending it before: I have not enjoy'd one minutes repose since my returne (now a fortnight past) 'till this very morning; having ben ever since soliciting for a little monye to preserve my miserable flock from perishing: On Saturday, very late, I dispatch'd Mr Barbour towards (4) my Kentish Circle where our sick people are in quarters; and at his returne, I hope to present you a compleate Accompt but 'till this instant morning I had not written one line of these tedious Papers; so that if through hast (the parent of mistakes) there may happly appeare some Escapes, give Pardon to your Servant; or let me purchase it with this small Present of Fragments (such as yet you have ben pleasd to accept) and a little Booke, that I also recommend to excuse my expense of such Leasure as I can redeeme from the other impertinences of my life. As to the Report which I send you, I would receive it as a favour; however your resolutions of putting it in execution may succeede (the tyme of yeare being so farr Elaps'd, in reguard of Action, and more immediate use) it might yet be gracefully presented to his Royall Highnesse, or rather indeede, to his Majestie himselfe, who has so frequently ben pleas'd to take notice of it to me as an acceptable Project; because it would afflict me to have them thinke I have either ben remisse, or trifling in my proposall.\n\nThis obligation I can onely hope for from your Dexterity, Addresse and Friendship, who am,\n\nSir,  \nYour most affectionate, and humble servant  \nJEvelyn:\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n\nSir,\n\nThere is nothing in the other Paper which you commanded me to returne; but what is included in these, with ample, and (I hope) considerable improvements.\n\nI must beg a Copy of these Papers when your Clearkes are at Leasure, having never a duplicate by me; and it may happly neede a review.\n\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\nSir,\n\nThe Bearer hereoff Roger Winne, being our Messenger (and without whose service I cannot possibly be, having so frequent occasions of sending him about buisinesse belonging to my troublesome Employment) dos by me supplicate your protection, that he may not be Pressed, of which he is hourely in danger as he travells about our affaires, without your particular indulgence, which I therefore, conjure you to let him have under your hand and signature.\n\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Sayes Court<br />\n26 March 1666</p>\n\nSir,\n\nIf to render you an account of the progresse of my late Proposal, be any testimony of my obedience to your Commands; be pleas'd to believe, that I most faithfully present it in these papers according to the best of my talent. And if you find the Estimate considerably to exceede the first Calculation, you will remember it was made to the meridian of London; that the Walles were, both by his Majestie and the directions of the Principall Officers to be made thicker, and higher; that the Materials, and Worke-men were presum'd to be found much cheaper in the Country; and that the Place and area to build on was suppos'd a Level: But it has fall'n out so much to our prejudice, and beyond all expectation in these particulars; that to commence with the ground, we could not in 4 or 5 miles walking about Chatham and Rochester, find one convenient spot that would bear a level of 200 foote square, unlesse it were one Field beyond the Dock, in the Occupation of Mr Commissioner Pett neare the bogg and marsh, which has neither solid foundation, nor fresh-water to it. There is a very handsome greene Close at the end of the Long Rope-house towards Chatham; but the declivity is so suddaine and greate to the West, that lesse than a ten-foote raising will not bring it to such a rectitude as that we can lay our plate upon the Wall, which will be a considerable trouble and charge to reforme, as may easily be demonstrated: For either the earth must be so much abated towards the East, or the Wall advanc'd to the height of neere 20 foote, whiles one Extreame of the roofe will touch the superficies of the earth: Besides, the field is not above 150 feet wide: But supposing all this might be encounter'd (as indeede it might with charge) it bordures so neere to the Rope-houses, the Dock, and that ample way leading to it from the Hill-house and Chatham, as might endanger his Majesties people in case of any Contagion; because it will be impossible to restraine them from sometimes mingling amongst the Worke-men and others, who have Employment in the Dock, when the Convalescent-men shall be able, or permitted to walk abroad. This, and some other difficulties made us quit the thoughts of that otherwise gracefully situated place. After many other Surveyes, we at last pitch'd on a Field call'd the Warren, just beneath the Mill, and reguarding the North towards the River.

Five hundred mens quarters at 1s per diem coming to \u00a325 per diem, 175 per week, 700 per Month, 9408 per Annum.\n\nUpon which I assume, if \u00a33994, by five-hundred men, or \u00a33640 in foure-hundred men, or, lastly, if but \u00a32990 be sav'd in one Yeare in the quarters of 400 sick persons, etc., there would a farr greater summ be saved in more than 6000 men; there having ben sent 7000 Sick and Wounded men to Cure in my district onely, and of those 2800 put on shore at Chatham and Rochester, for which station I propos'd the Remedy. Now, five-hundred sick-persons quarter'd at a Towne in the Victualers and scattered Ale-houses (as the Costome is), will take up at least 160 houses, there being very few of those miserable places which afford accommodation for above 2 or 3 in an house; with, frequently at greate distances, employ of Chirurgeons, Nurses, and Officers innumerable; so as when we have ben distress'd for Chirurgeons, some of them (upon computation) walked 5 or 6 miles every day, by going but from quarter to quarter, and not ben able to visite their patients as they ought: Whereas, in our Hospital, they are continualy at hand: We have essay'd to hire some capacious empty houses, but could never meet with any tollerably convenient; and to have many, or more then one, would be chargeable and very troublesome: By our Infirmary, then we have these considerable advantages.\n\nAt 6<i>d</i> per diem each (in the way of Commons), the sick shall have as good, and much more proper and wholesome diet, than now they have in the Ale-houses, where they are fed with trash, and Embezil their monye more to inflame themselves, retard and destroy their Cures out of ignorance or intemperance; whiles a sober Matron governs the Nurses, lookes to their provisions, Rollers, Linnen etc. And the nurses attend the Sick, Wash, Sweepe, and Serve the Offices, The Coock and Laundrer comprehended in the number, and at the same rate, etc. By this Method likewise are the almost indefinite number of Chirurgeons and Officers exceedingly reduc'd; The Sick dieted, kept from drinke and Intemperance, and consequently from most unavoydably relapsing: They are hindred from Wandering, Slipping-away, and dispersion: They are more sedulously attended; the Physitian better inspects the Chirurgeons, who neither can nor will be in all places, as now they are scattered, in the nasty Corners of the Townes: They are sooner, and more certainely cur'd (for I have at present neere 30 bedds employ'd in a Barne at Graves-end, which has taught us much of this experience). They are receiv'd and discharg'd with infinitely more ease: Our Accompts better and more exactly kept: A vast, and very considerable Summ is saved (not to say gain'd) to his Majestie: The materialls of the house will be good if taken downe; or, if let stand, it may serve in tyme of Peace, for a Store, or Worke-house: The Furniture will (much of it) be useful upon like occasion; And what is to be esteem'd none of the least Virtues of it, 'twill totaly cure the altogether intollerable clamor and difficulties of rude and ungratefull people; their Landlords and Nurses, rays'd by their poverty upon the least obstruction of constant and Weekely payes; for want of which they bring an ill repute upon his Majesties Service, Incense the very Magistrates and better sort of Inhabitants (neighbours to them) who too frequently promote (I am sorry to speake it) their mutinies; so as they have been sometimes menacing to expose our Men in the streetes, where some have most inhospitably perish'd: In fine, This would encounter all Objections whatsoever; is an honorable, Charitable, and frugal Provision; Effectual, full of Encouragement, and very practicable; so as, however for the present it may be consider'd, I cannot but persist in wishing it might be resolv'd upon towards Autumne at the farthest; Chatham and Rochester alone having within 17 or 18 monethes cost his Majestie full \u00a313,000 in cures and quarters; halfe whereof, would have neere ben saved had this method ben establish'd: Add to this, the almost constant station of his Majesties shipps at the Buoy in the Noore, and river of Chatham; the Clamor of that place against our quartering these, this crazy tyme, and the altogether impossibility of providing else-where for such numbers as continualy presse in upon us there, more than any where else, after Action, or the returne of any of his Majesties fleete: which, with what has ben Offer'd, may recommend this Project, by your favourable representation of the premises, for a permanent Establishment in that Place especially, if his Majestie and Royal Highnesse so thinke meete. This Account, being what I have ben able to lay before you, as the Effects of my late Inspection upon the Place, by Commands of the Honourable the Principal Officers, I request through your hands may be address'd to them from,\n\nSir,  \nYour most obedient servant,  \nJEvelyn\n\nWe might this Summer burne our owne Bricks, and procure timber at the best hand, which would save a considerable charge.\n\n<div class=\"hr\"></div><hr />\n",

The letters are also often posted in the annotations for that day's diary entry, but as one of Evelyn's letters to Pepys for 26 March 1666 is long and has a lot of tabular data, Terry Foreman had the good idea of posting it in the In-Depth Articles section. So here is the exchange of four letters for today: ", 
            "text_html": "<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>To Samuell Pepys, Esqr<br />\nOne of the principall officers<br />\nof his Majesties Navy at Navy Office</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Sayes Court<br />\n26 March 1666</p>\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n<p>I know not with what successe I have endeavourd to performe your Commands; but it has ben to the uttmost of my skill, of which you are to be my judges: The favour I bespeake of you is, your pardon for not sending it before: I have not enjoy'd one minutes repose since my returne (now a fortnight past) 'till this very morning; having ben ever since soliciting for a little monye to preserve my miserable flock from perishing: On Saturday, very late, I dispatch'd Mr Barbour towards (4) my Kentish Circle where our sick people are in quarters; and at his returne, I hope to present you a compleate Accompt but 'till this instant morning I had not written one line of these tedious Papers; so that if through hast (the parent of mistakes) there may happly appeare some Escapes, give Pardon to your Servant; or let me purchase it with this small Present of Fragments (such as yet you have ben pleasd to accept) and a little Booke, that I also recommend to excuse my expense of such Leasure as I can redeeme from the other impertinences of my life. As to the Report which I send you, I would receive it as a favour; however your resolutions of putting it in execution may succeede (the tyme of yeare being so farr Elaps'd, in reguard of Action, and more immediate use) it might yet be gracefully presented to his Royall Highnesse, or rather indeede, to his Majestie himselfe, who has so frequently ben pleas'd to take notice of it to me as an acceptable Project; because it would afflict me to have them thinke I have either ben remisse, or trifling in my proposall.</p>\n<p>This obligation I can onely hope for from your Dexterity, Addresse and Friendship, who am,</p>\n<p>Sir,<br />\nYour most affectionate, and humble servant<br />\nJEvelyn:</p>\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the other Paper which you commanded me to returne; but what is included in these, with ample, and (I hope) considerable improvements.</p>\n<p>I must beg a Copy of these Papers when your Clearkes are at Leasure, having never a duplicate by me; and it may happly neede a review.</p>\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n<p>The Bearer hereoff Roger Winne, being our Messenger (and without whose service I cannot possibly be, having so frequent occasions of sending him about buisinesse belonging to my troublesome Employment) dos by me supplicate your protection, that he may not be Pressed, of which he is hourely in danger as he travells about our affaires, without your particular indulgence, which I therefore, conjure you to let him have under your hand and signature.</p>\n<div class=\"hr\"></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Sayes Court<br />\n26 March 1666</p>\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n<p>If to render you an account of the progresse of my late Proposal, be any testimony of my obedience to your Commands; be pleas'd to believe, that I most faithfully present it in these papers according to the best of my talent. And if you find the Estimate considerably to exceede the first Calculation, you will remember it was made to the meridian of London; that the Walles were, both by his Majestie and the directions of the Principall Officers to be made thicker, and higher; that the Materials, and Worke-men were presum'd to be found much cheaper in the Country; and that the Place and area to build on was suppos'd a Level: But it has fall'n out so much to our prejudice, and beyond all expectation in these particulars; that to commence with the ground, we could not in 4 or 5 miles walking about Chatham and Rochester, find one convenient spot that would bear a level of 200 foote square, unlesse it were one Field beyond the Dock, in the Occupation of Mr Commissioner Pett neare the bogg and marsh, which has neither solid foundation, nor fresh-water to it. There is a very handsome greene Close at the end of the Long Rope-house towards Chatham; but the declivity is so suddaine and greate to the West, that lesse than a ten-foote raising will not bring it to such a rectitude as that we can lay our plate upon the Wall, which will be a considerable trouble and charge to reforme, as may easily be demonstrated: For either the earth must be so much abated towards the East, or the Wall advanc'd to the height of neere 20 foote, whiles one Extreame of the roofe will touch the superficies of the earth: Besides, the field is not above 150 feet wide: But supposing all this might be encounter'd (as indeede it might with charge) it bordures so neere to the Rope-houses, the Dock, and that ample way leading to it from the Hill-house and Chatham, as might endanger his Majesties people in case of any Contagion; because it will be impossible to restraine them from sometimes mingling amongst the Worke-men and others, who have Employment in the Dock, when the Convalescent-men shall be able, or permitted to walk abroad.

The Accesse is commodious; it has a well of excellent Water, ready dugg, and wanting only repaires; and though this ground be likewise somewhat uneven, yet, with helpe, it will carry about 240 feet in length, and 150 in breadth, allowing the filling up of some Vallies and depressures of about 4 or 5 foote deepe, to be taken from severall risings: This, for many reasons, I conceive to be the fittest for our purpose, it having also a solid foundation on the Chalke, and being at a competent distance from all dangerous commerce with the Towne, which will greately contribute to the health of the sick, and protection of the Inhabitants; but being at present in Lease to the Chest, leave must be obtayn'd, and the Tennant, who now rents it, satisfied; in all which Mr Commissioner Pet (whose direction and assistance I tooke, according to your injunctions) informes me, there will be no difficulty:</p>\n<p>Upon examination of the Materials on the Place:</p>\n<table class=\"full valign-bottom\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th class=\"number\">\u00a3</th>\n<th class=\"number\"><i>s</i></th>\n<th class=\"number\"><i>d</i></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bricks will not be deliverd at the place under</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">18:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lime, per Load, containing 32 Bushels, per thousand</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">16:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Drift Sand, by Tonn</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyles, per thousand deliverd</td>\n<td class=\"number\">01:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">01:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heart-Lathes, per Load, containing 36 bundles</td>\n<td class=\"number\">02:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">10:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sawing, per hundred</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">03:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workmen sufficient (in which was our greate mistake)</td>\n<td class=\"number\">00:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">02:</td>\n<td class=\"number\">06</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Upon these Matirials we conceiv'd thus of the Scantlings.</p>\n<table class=\"full valign-bottom\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Walls, at 1 Brick</td>\n<td class=\"number\">&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wall-plates</td>\n<td class=\"number\"d>9 in.</td>\n<td class=\"number\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parallel rafters</td>\n<td class=\"number\">9</td>\n<td class=\"number\">6 middle</td>\n<td class=\"number\">16&frac12; feet long</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td class=\"number\">11</td>\n<td class=\"number\">7 ends</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single rafters</td>\n<td class=\"number\">4&frac12;</td>\n<td class=\"number\">3&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Purlins</td>\n<td class=\"number\">9</td>\n<td class=\"number\">6</td>\n<td class=\"number\">17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Binding-beames</td>\n<td class=\"number\">12</td>\n<td class=\"number\">12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windoe-frames</td>\n<td class=\"number\">4&frac12;</td>\n<td class=\"number\">3&frac12;</td>\n<td class=\"number\">4 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dore-cases, in brick-Worke: single-doores</td>\n<td class=\"number\">7</td>\n<td class=\"number\">6</td>\n<td class=\"number\">6 2 8in</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The two outward double, with Architrave</td>\n<td class=\"number\">7</td>\n<td class=\"number\">6</td>\n<td class=\"number\">9 9 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ground-floor gist</td>\n<td class=\"number\">4</td>\n<td class=\"number\">4</td>\n<td class=\"number\">18</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>And if stone-floores to the 4 Corner-roomes, as has been since judg'd more commodious, the</p>\n<table class=\"full valign-bottom\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Gists</td>\n<td class=\"number\">8</td>\n<td class=\"number\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>So'men</td>\n<td class=\"number\">14</td>\n<td class=\"number\">11</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Besides Partitions, Posts, Interstise, Quarterage.</p>\n<p>At these scantlings, together with the alteration of the Walles for height and thicknesse, etc.</p>\n<p>Every rod of square Brick-worke, solid, at 1&frac12; thick: containing in bricks of 9 Inch: about 12 bricks Long, to 16&frac12; in height: 15 bricks to every 3-feet high, which to 16&frac12; is about 83: so that 83 by 21 is 1743 bricks superficial: This, at the design'd thicknesse, is every square-rod 5229 bricks, which I suppose at 17 (the lowest we can expect) deliver'd at the place, is every rod square, \u00a309 08<i>s</i> 01<i>d</i>.

Now, five-hundred sick-persons quarter'd at a Towne in the Victualers and scattered Ale-houses (as the Costome is), will take up at least 160 houses, there being very few of those miserable places which afford accommodation for above 2 or 3 in an house; with, frequently at greate distances, employ of Chirurgeons, Nurses, and Officers innumerable; so as when we have ben distress'd for Chirurgeons, some of them (upon computation) walked 5 or 6 miles every day, by going but from quarter to quarter, and not ben able to visite their patients as they ought: Whereas, in our Hospital, they are continualy at hand: We have essay'd to hire some capacious empty houses, but could never meet with any tollerably convenient; and to have many, or more then one, would be chargeable and very troublesome: By our Infirmary, then we have these considerable advantages.</p>\n<p>At 6<i>d</i> per diem each (in the way of Commons), the sick shall have as good, and much more proper and wholesome diet, than now they have in the Ale-houses, where they are fed with trash, and Embezil their monye more to inflame themselves, retard and destroy their Cures out of ignorance or intemperance; whiles a sober Matron governs the Nurses, lookes to their provisions, Rollers, Linnen etc. And the nurses attend the Sick, Wash, Sweepe, and Serve the Offices, The Coock and Laundrer comprehended in the number, and at the same rate, etc. By this Method likewise are the almost indefinite number of Chirurgeons and Officers exceedingly reduc'd; The Sick dieted, kept from drinke and Intemperance, and consequently from most unavoydably relapsing: They are hindred from Wandering, Slipping-away, and dispersion: They are more sedulously attended; the Physitian better inspects the Chirurgeons, who neither can nor will be in all places, as now they are scattered, in the nasty Corners of the Townes: They are sooner, and more certainely cur'd (for I have at present neere 30 bedds employ'd in a Barne at Graves-end, which has taught us much of this experience). They are receiv'd and discharg'd with infinitely more ease: Our Accompts better and more exactly kept: A vast, and very considerable Summ is saved (not to say gain'd) to his Majestie: The materialls of the house will be good if taken downe; or, if let stand, it may serve in tyme of Peace, for a Store, or Worke-house: The Furniture will (much of it) be useful upon like occasion; And what is to be esteem'd none of the least Virtues of it, 'twill totaly cure the altogether intollerable clamor and difficulties of rude and ungratefull people; their Landlords and Nurses, rays'd by their poverty upon the least obstruction of constant and Weekely payes; for want of which they bring an ill repute upon his Majesties Service, Incense the very Magistrates and better sort of Inhabitants (neighbours to them) who too frequently promote (I am sorry to speake it) their mutinies; so as they have been sometimes menacing to expose our Men in the streetes, where some have most inhospitably perish'd: In fine, This would encounter all Objections whatsoever; is an honorable, Charitable, and frugal Provision; Effectual, full of Encouragement, and very practicable; so as, however for the present it may be consider'd, I cannot but persist in wishing it might be resolv'd upon towards Autumne at the farthest; Chatham and Rochester alone having within 17 or 18 monethes cost his Majestie full \u00a313,000 in cures and quarters; halfe whereof, would have neere ben saved had this method ben establish'd: Add to this, the almost constant station of his Majesties shipps at the Buoy in the Noore, and river of Chatham; the Clamor of that place against our quartering these, this crazy tyme, and the altogether impossibility of providing else-where for such numbers as continualy presse in upon us there, more than any where else, after Action, or the returne of any of his Majesties fleete: which, with what has ben Offer'd, may recommend this Project, by your favourable representation of the premises, for a permanent Establishment in that Place especially, if his Majestie and Royal Highnesse so thinke meete.

The literary reputation of Pepys in his lifetime was limited, following which the personal journal was left in obscurity for more than a century after his death. The eventual publication of the diary revealed Pepys as an exceptionally skilled recorder of the political events of his time, and also everyday life. Pepys' record of contemporary events has become an important source for historians seeking an understanding of life in London during the mid-seventeenth century. Pepys kept the diary for nine years, as a virtually daily record that was to stretch to more than a million words, with a quality that entertains and inspires people in the current day, nearly three and a half centuries after it was written.\n \nSamuel Pepys was born on February 23 1633, at Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, in London, the son of John Pepys, a tailor, and his wife, Margaret Kite. Within a few years, the autocratic rule of Charles I (reigned 1625-1649) sparked the English Civil War, and at the age of 15, Pepys witnessed the execution of the monarch in 1649. After attending St Paul's School in London, Pepys moved to Magdalene College, at Cambridge University, in 1651, and left three years later with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After leaving university, Pepys worked in the household of Edward Montagu, a cousin of his father. The subsequent advancement of Pepys owed a great deal to the patronage of Edward Montagu, who would be created the first Earl of Sandwich in 1660. Edward was the great great grandfather of John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, after whom the sandwich was named in the eighteenth century. In 1655 Pepys, aged 22, married Elizabeth St Michel, who was only 15 -- Elizabeth had been born in England into a French Huguenot family. Shortly afterwards, probably in 1656, Pepys began his career as a civil servant, by taking a post as clerk to George Downing (who gave his name to Downing Street) at the Exchequer. Samuel's marriage to Elizabeth was soon under strain, causing a separation during the late 1650s, and he was also troubled by a kidney stone, which was successfully removed in an operation of 1658. Pepys travelled abroad for the first time in 1659, sailing to the Baltic Sea, where he delivered letters from the British republican government to Montagu, who was mediating in a war between Denmark and Sweden. \n\nPepys started to write his diary, using shorthand, on New Year's Day 1660, at the age of 26. The opening sentences of the diary ran as follows:\n\n> Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe yard, having my wife and servant Jane, and no more in family than us three. My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again. The condition of the State was thus. Viz. the Rump, after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert, was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. Lawson lie still in the River and Monke is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will, without being forced to it. The new Common Council of the City doth speak very high; and hath sent to Monke their sword-bearer to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament, which is at present the desires and the hopes and expectation of all. \n\nThe combination of the personal and political remained a constant theme of Pepys' diary. Indeed the young Pepys was soon on the fringe of historic events. In May 1660, having been found a place by Montagu, Pepys joined a naval expedition to the Netherlands with the purpose of returning Charles, son of the late king, from exile, ahead of the restoration of the monarchy. The next month saw Pepys promoted to a post in the Navy Board, based at Seething Lane in the City of London, with a salary of \u00a3350 per year. Appointment as a Justice of the Peace followed in September 1660. On April 23 1661 -- Saint George's Day -- Pepys attended the coronation of Charles II, which was held at Westminster Abbey. In 1662 Pepys was appointed to a government committee which oversaw the administration of Tangier, a colony acquired as part of the dowry of Katherine of Branganza, who married Charles II on May 22 of that year, at Portsmouth. Pepys was to remain a member of this committee through to 1679. \n\nPepys kept a detailed account of his activities, and thoughts, in the journal -- this being the word that he used. Very few days were omitted, although Pepys often wrote up entries in retrospect. His work for the navy was explained at length, as public service was combined with attendant opportunities for private enterprise, enabling Pepys to accumulate a personal fortune. Samuel's domestic routines with Elizabeth featured in the diary, and trouble with servants was a recurring theme. Pepys obviously enjoyed socialising with family and friends, as drinking, eating, and visits to the theatre were chronicled, along with his progress in learning to sing and play musical instruments. Pepys was a womaniser, who was frequently unfaithful to Elizabeth, and recorded his sexual liaisons with a series of women in the diary. Throughout the diary Pepys wrote extensively, and repetitively, about matters such as the time he got up in the morning, his finances, the weather, and the food that he ate. Pepys regularly ended entries by noting that he ate supper and went to bed. Alongside an active life, and extrovert personality, Pepys wrote about his mind being troubled by various thoughts and worries. Pepys continually tied himself up in knots with a series of vows for virtuous behaviour, and acts of penance when he failed to live up to his ideals. It appears to me that Pepys was suffering from what is now termed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\n\nThe young and successful Pepys often reflected upon his good fortune. Here is his diary entry for October 10 1664:\n\n> This day by the blessing of God, my wife and I have been married nine years -- but my head being full of business, I did not think of it, to keep it in any extraordinary manner. But bless God for our long lives and love and health together, which the same God long continue, I wish from my very heart. \n\nPepys had a great curiosity about the world, and used a Latin motto (borrowed from a phrase of the Roman politician and philosopher, Cicero) which has been translated as \"The Mind is the Man\". Pepys' interest in furthering knowledge led to him being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1665. In contrast to highbrow learning, Pepys showed interest in women of low virtue. Besides affairs with several women, Pepys appeared to aspire to a relationship with Barbara Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine, a mistress of Charles II. Pepys often glimpsed \"my Lady Castlemayne\" in London society, and wrote in his entry for August 15 1665:\n  \n> Up by 4 a-clock and walked to Greenwich, where called at Capt. Cockes and to his chamber, he being in bed -- where something put my last night's dream into my head, which I think is the best that ever was dreamed -- which was that I had my Lady Castlemayne in my armes and was admitted to use all the dalliance I desired with her, and then dreamed that this could not be awake but that it was only a dream. But that since it was a dream and that I took so much real pleasure in it, what a happy thing it would be, if when we are in our graves (as Shakespeere resembles it), we could dream, and dream such dreams as this -- that then we should not need to be so fearful of death as we are this plague-time. \n\nPepys' reflections on the Great Plague, a tragedy estimated to have claimed the lives of as many as 100,000 people in London during 1665 and 1666, struck a much more sombre, and appropriate, note on October 16 1665:   \n\n> I walked to the Tower. But Lord, how empty the streets are, and melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets, full of sores, and so many sad stories overheard as I walk, everybody talking of this dead, and that man sick, and so many in this place, and so many in that. And they tell me that in Westminster there is never a physitian, and but one apothecary left, all being dead -- but that there are great hopes of a great decrease this week: God send it. \n\nOn March 10 1666 Pepys experienced an enjoyable day. In between spells at his office in the morning and evening, Pepys spent time with three women named Elizabeth, with these being his wife, and their friends Mrs Knipp and Mrs Pierce. Lunch at the Pepys' home was followed by a shopping trip, during which clothes were acquired by the ladies, and the group all \"eat some fine cakes\". Having recounted the events of the day, Pepys reflected:\n\n> The truth is, I do indulge myself a little the more pleasure, knowing that this is the proper age of my life to do it, and out of my observation that most men that do thrive in the world do forget to take pleasure during the time that they are getting their estate but reserve that till they have got one, and then it is too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure.\n\nAt the start of September 1666, the Great Fire of London raged for four days, and Pepys described the disaster at length in his diary. On September 4, the penultimate day of the fire, Pepys recorded the burying of important possessions in his garden as a means of protecting them from the advancing blaze -- the items included \"papers of my office\" plus \"my parmazan cheese as well as my wine\". Pepys concluded this entry:\n\n> W. Hewer [Pepys' clerk] this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, but telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in pye Corner being burned. So that it is got so far that way and all the Old Bayly, and was running down to Fleetestreet. And Pauls is burned, and all Cheapside. I wrote to my father this night; but the post-house being burned, the letter could not go. \n\nThe Pauls to which Pepys referred was the old St Paul's Cathedral. This cathedral had been built by the Normans to replace the Church of St Paul the Apostle, which had been wrecked by fire in 1087. The tomb of Ethelred \"the Unready\", which had escaped the effects of the blaze in 1087, was lost in the fire of 1666. Two years later Pepys recorded the demolition of the ruins of St Paul's, ahead of a planned re-building. The current St Paul's Cathedral was constructed between 1675 and 1710. Although St Paul's has not staged as many state occasions as Westminster Abbey, the former was the venue for the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer in 1981 -- this being the first royal wedding at the site since Prince Arthur wedded Catherine of Aragon at the previous St Paul's in 1501. \n\nThe catastrophes of plague and fire in London coincided with national crisis, as Britain endured the Second Dutch War between 1665 and 1667. With this war against the Netherlands revolving around naval battles -- including an audacious Dutch raid along the River Thames in June 1667 -- Pepys had an important administrative role. In both 1667 and 1668 Pepys appeared on behalf of the navy before Parliamentary committees investigating its work. Pepys recorded his actions of March 5 1668 with pride:\n\n> After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the report of the Committee, I begin our defence most acceptably and smoothly, and continued at it without any hesitation or losse but with full scope and all my reason free about me, as if it had been at my own table, from that time till past 3 in the afternoon; and so endeed without any interruption from the Speaker, but we withdrew. And there all my fellow-officers, and all the world that was within hearing, did congratulate me and cry up my speech as the best thing they ever heard, and my fellow-officers overjoyed in it.\n\nDuring June 1668 Pepys took a holiday tour of southern England. This included a visit to Stonehenge on June 11, which Pepys recorded as follows:\n\n> To Stonehege, over the plain and some prodigious great hills, even to fright us. Came thither, and find them as prodigious as any tales I ever heard of them, and worth going this journey to see. God knows what their use was. They are hard to tell, but yet may be told. \n\nThe tales of Stonehenge transfix contemporary visitors, in the same way as they captured the imagination of Pepys in the seventeenth century.\n\nIn his diary entry for February 23 1669, Samuel records a rather disturbing incident, during a day out with his wife plus two of his relatives, Bab and Betty Pepys: \n\n> I now took them to Westminster Abbey and there did show them all the tombs very finely, having one with us alone (there being other company this day to see the tombs, it being Shrove Tuesday); and here we did see, by perticular favour, the body of Queen Katherine of Valois, and had her upper part of her body in my hands. And I did kiss her mouth, reflecting upon it that I did kiss a Queen, and that this was my birthday, 36 years old, that I did first kiss a Queen. \n\nAt this point, two hundred and thirty two years had passed since the death of Katherine, who was the widow of Henry V. \n\nPepys ceased writing the diary on May 31 1669, fearing for his eyesight. He had been experiencing pains in his eyes for five years, and these were to continue for the remainder of his life, but Pepys' worry that he would go blind proved unfounded. More importantly, an unexpected tragedy struck later in 1669, as Elizabeth died on November 10, from the effects of a fever caught during an extended holiday with Samuel in the Netherlands, Flanders, and France. Elizabeth was just 28 at her death, and Samuel was left a widower -- he never re-married. \n\nDuring the next few years, Pepys continued to advance as a civil servant, and became Secretary to the Admiralty Commission in 1673. Pepys also began a new career as a politician, being MP for Castle Rising, in Norfolk, from 1673 until 1678. Pepys was briefly MP for Harwich during 1679, but in that year he fell from grace, being falsely accused of involvement in the \"Popish Plot\", and imprisoned in the Tower of London for six weeks. In 1680 Pepys produced an account of Charles II's escape after the Battle of Worcester in 1651, when he famously hid in the Boscobel Oak -- with this being dictated by the king. During 1683 and 1684 Pepys was at Tangier, participating in the British abandonment of the colony, and wrote a diary of his experiences, which was to be published in 1841, but lacks the greatness of the journal from the 1660s. In 1684 Pepys was appointed Secretary for Naval Affairs, and also elected as President of the Royal Society -- he was to hold the latter position for two years. \n\nCharles II died in 1685, being succeeded by James II, his brother, and Pepys returned to Parliament, as MP for Harwich. James II's attempts to restore Catholicism to Britain were to lead to his downfall. In 1688, twenty eight years after Charles II had returned from the Netherlands, his nephew William of Orange, a Dutchman who was married to Mary, a daughter of James II, invaded England, landing at Brixham in Devon. The arrival of William of Orange prompted James to flee to France, whereupon Parliament formally concluded that he had abdicated. William III and Mary II took the throne as joint monarchs on February 13 1689. Pepys, who had been defeated at Harwich in a General Election during January 1689, disapproved of the new regime, and resigned from his post as Naval Secretary seven days after William and Mary were appointed as monarchs. This proved to be the end of Pepys' distinguished career in public service. In an echo of the events of 1679, Pepys was falsely suspected of Jacobite activities, being imprisoned in 1689, and again the following year. In 1690 Pepys published \"Memoires Relating to the State of the Royal Navy\", a book about his administrative career. \n\nDuring retirement, Pepys' main enthusiasm was the massive expansion, and cataloguing, of his library, which grew to more than 3,000 volumes -- with books being combined with manuscripts and other materials. Pepys received great assistance in the library project from his nephew, John Jackson. In his will, Pepys bequeathed the library to Jackson, with the instruction that upon the death of the latter the collection should be transferred to Magdalene College -- where Pepys had been a student as a youth -- to be preserved \"for the benefit of posterity\". Samuel Pepys moved from London to Clapham (at that time a small town beyond the boundaries of the capital city) in 1701, and it was at Clapham that he died, on May 26 1703, aged 70. \n\nPepys' diary was moved to Magdelene College in 1724, the year after the death of John Jackson. A century passed, however, before the shorthand diary was transcribed by John Smith, a student at the college. A relatively short selection from Pepys' diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, was published in 1825 by Henry Colburn (the man who issued Benjamin Disraeli's debut novel, \"Vivian Grey\", to a rather baffled readership the following year). Three further editions of Braybrooke's version of the diary were to be published, each of these being slightly expanded. A new transcription of the diary by Mynors Bright appeared in six volumes, comprising about eighty per cent of the full text, between 1875 and 1879. Following the death of Bright in 1883, a further version of his transcription, edited by H B Wheatley, was published in ten volumes between 1893 and 1899. Wheatley's version represented about ninety per cent of the diary, with most of the omissions being made in line with what was considered decent in nineteenth century Britain. The full diary was finally published as \"The Diary of Samuel Pepys, a New and Complete Transcription\", edited by Robert Latham and William Matthews, running to eleven volumes, including extensive commentary, between 1970 and 1983. Matthews died in 1976 before this labour of love was completed. Latham subsequently edited \"The Shorter Pepys\", a single volume condensation of the edition he had worked on with Matthews, containing about a third of the text of the diary, which was published in 1985. This was reissued in 2003 as \"The Diary of Samuel Pepys: A Selection\", and provides the most accessible version of the diary. \n\nI follow in the footsteps of Pepys as somebody who writes a regular diary, and share his interest in government administration, being a former civil servant, and current local government officer. My civil service career lasted a mere nine months, during 1996 and 1997, when I worked for the Intervention Board, an offshoot of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Intervention Board, which was based in Reading, and has since been converted into the Rural Payments Agency, administered the European Union's infamous Common Agricultural Policy. I arrived a few weeks after the EU banned the export of British beef, due to the effects of BSE. With the BSE crisis dominating the organisation's activity at the time, staff referred to the Intervention Board as the Ministry of Mad Cows.\n\nThree hundred and twenty four years after the opening of Pepys' journal, I started my diary on the first day of 1984. Two years later I read a commentary on Pepys' work, in \"A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries\" by Thomas Mallon (published 1984). This was followed in 1988 by my reading numerous passages by Pepys in \"The Faber Book of Diaries\", edited by Simon Brett (published 1987). Having enjoyed these introductions to Pepys, I planned to read more of his diary, but must admit that for many years I was daunted by the length of the work. After all, the drastic edit that is Latham's single volume edition has a text that runs to over a thousand pages. I acquired a copy of Latham's 2003 version of Pepys' diary four years after its appearance, and began reading it early in 2008. A few months later, I am still reading Samuel Pepys' diary. On most days I enjoy the routine of reading a few of Pepys' diary entries, normally late in the evening, as supper is followed by bed. \n",

The literary reputation of Pepys in his lifetime was limited, following which the personal journal was left in obscurity for more than a century after his death. The eventual publication of the diary revealed Pepys as an exceptionally skilled recorder of the political events of his time, and also everyday life. Pepys' record of contemporary events has become an important source for historians seeking an understanding of life in London during the mid-seventeenth century. Pepys kept the diary for nine years, as a virtually daily record that was to stretch to more than a million words, with a quality that entertains and inspires people in the current day, nearly three and a half centuries after it was written.</p>\n<p>Samuel Pepys was born on February 23 1633, at Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, in London, the son of John Pepys, a tailor, and his wife, Margaret Kite. Within a few years, the autocratic rule of Charles I (reigned 1625-1649) sparked the English Civil War, and at the age of 15, Pepys witnessed the execution of the monarch in 1649. After attending St Paul's School in London, Pepys moved to Magdalene College, at Cambridge University, in 1651, and left three years later with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After leaving university, Pepys worked in the household of Edward Montagu, a cousin of his father. The subsequent advancement of Pepys owed a great deal to the patronage of Edward Montagu, who would be created the first Earl of Sandwich in 1660. Edward was the great great grandfather of John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, after whom the sandwich was named in the eighteenth century. In 1655 Pepys, aged 22, married Elizabeth St Michel, who was only 15 -- Elizabeth had been born in England into a French Huguenot family. Shortly afterwards, probably in 1656, Pepys began his career as a civil servant, by taking a post as clerk to George Downing (who gave his name to Downing Street) at the Exchequer. Samuel's marriage to Elizabeth was soon under strain, causing a separation during the late 1650s, and he was also troubled by a kidney stone, which was successfully removed in an operation of 1658. Pepys travelled abroad for the first time in 1659, sailing to the Baltic Sea, where he delivered letters from the British republican government to Montagu, who was mediating in a war between Denmark and Sweden. </p>\n<p>Pepys started to write his diary, using shorthand, on New Year's Day 1660, at the age of 26. The opening sentences of the diary ran as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe yard, having my wife and servant Jane, and no more in family than us three. My wife, after the absence of her terms for seven weeks, gave me hopes of her being with child, but on the last day of the year she hath them again. The condition of the State was thus. Viz. the Rump, after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert, was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. Lawson lie still in the River and Monke is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will, without being forced to it. The new Common Council of the City doth speak very high; and hath sent to Monke their sword-bearer to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament, which is at present the desires and the hopes and expectation of all. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The combination of the personal and political remained a constant theme of Pepys' diary. Indeed the young Pepys was soon on the fringe of historic events. In May 1660, having been found a place by Montagu, Pepys joined a naval expedition to the Netherlands with the purpose of returning Charles, son of the late king, from exile, ahead of the restoration of the monarchy. The next month saw Pepys promoted to a post in the Navy Board, based at Seething Lane in the City of London, with a salary of \u00a3350 per year. Appointment as a Justice of the Peace followed in September 1660. On April 23 1661 -- Saint George's Day -- Pepys attended the coronation of Charles II, which was held at Westminster Abbey. In 1662 Pepys was appointed to a government committee which oversaw the administration of Tangier, a colony acquired as part of the dowry of Katherine of Branganza, who married Charles II on May 22 of that year, at Portsmouth. Pepys was to remain a member of this committee through to 1679. </p>\n<p>Pepys kept a detailed account of his activities, and thoughts, in the journal -- this being the word that he used. Very few days were omitted, although Pepys often wrote up entries in retrospect. His work for the navy was explained at length, as public service was combined with attendant opportunities for private enterprise, enabling Pepys to accumulate a personal fortune. Samuel's domestic routines with Elizabeth featured in the diary, and trouble with servants was a recurring theme. Pepys obviously enjoyed socialising with family and friends, as drinking, eating, and visits to the theatre were chronicled, along with his progress in learning to sing and play musical instruments. Pepys was a womaniser, who was frequently unfaithful to Elizabeth, and recorded his sexual liaisons with a series of women in the diary. Throughout the diary Pepys wrote extensively, and repetitively, about matters such as the time he got up in the morning, his finances, the weather, and the food that he ate. Pepys regularly ended entries by noting that he ate supper and went to bed. Alongside an active life, and extrovert personality, Pepys wrote about his mind being troubled by various thoughts and worries. Pepys continually tied himself up in knots with a series of vows for virtuous behaviour, and acts of penance when he failed to live up to his ideals. It appears to me that Pepys was suffering from what is now termed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.</p>\n<p>The young and successful Pepys often reflected upon his good fortune. Here is his diary entry for October 10 1664:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This day by the blessing of God, my wife and I have been married nine years -- but my head being full of business, I did not think of it, to keep it in any extraordinary manner. But bless God for our long lives and love and health together, which the same God long continue, I wish from my very heart. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pepys had a great curiosity about the world, and used a Latin motto (borrowed from a phrase of the Roman politician and philosopher, Cicero) which has been translated as \"The Mind is the Man\". Pepys' interest in furthering knowledge led to him being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1665. In contrast to highbrow learning, Pepys showed interest in women of low virtue. Besides affairs with several women, Pepys appeared to aspire to a relationship with Barbara Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine, a mistress of Charles II. Pepys often glimpsed \"my Lady Castlemayne\" in London society, and wrote in his entry for August 15 1665:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Up by 4 a-clock and walked to Greenwich, where called at Capt.

In 1684 Pepys was appointed Secretary for Naval Affairs, and also elected as President of the Royal Society -- he was to hold the latter position for two years. </p>\n<p>Charles II died in 1685, being succeeded by James II, his brother, and Pepys returned to Parliament, as MP for Harwich. James II's attempts to restore Catholicism to Britain were to lead to his downfall. In 1688, twenty eight years after Charles II had returned from the Netherlands, his nephew William of Orange, a Dutchman who was married to Mary, a daughter of James II, invaded England, landing at Brixham in Devon. The arrival of William of Orange prompted James to flee to France, whereupon Parliament formally concluded that he had abdicated. William III and Mary II took the throne as joint monarchs on February 13 1689. Pepys, who had been defeated at Harwich in a General Election during January 1689, disapproved of the new regime, and resigned from his post as Naval Secretary seven days after William and Mary were appointed as monarchs. This proved to be the end of Pepys' distinguished career in public service. In an echo of the events of 1679, Pepys was falsely suspected of Jacobite activities, being imprisoned in 1689, and again the following year. In 1690 Pepys published \"Memoires Relating to the State of the Royal Navy\", a book about his administrative career. </p>\n<p>During retirement, Pepys' main enthusiasm was the massive expansion, and cataloguing, of his library, which grew to more than 3,000 volumes -- with books being combined with manuscripts and other materials. Pepys received great assistance in the library project from his nephew, John Jackson. In his will, Pepys bequeathed the library to Jackson, with the instruction that upon the death of the latter the collection should be transferred to Magdalene College -- where Pepys had been a student as a youth -- to be preserved \"for the benefit of posterity\". Samuel Pepys moved from London to Clapham (at that time a small town beyond the boundaries of the capital city) in 1701, and it was at Clapham that he died, on May 26 1703, aged 70. </p>\n<p>Pepys' diary was moved to Magdelene College in 1724, the year after the death of John Jackson. A century passed, however, before the shorthand diary was transcribed by John Smith, a student at the college. A relatively short selection from Pepys' diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, was published in 1825 by Henry Colburn (the man who issued Benjamin Disraeli's debut novel, \"Vivian Grey\", to a rather baffled readership the following year). Three further editions of Braybrooke's version of the diary were to be published, each of these being slightly expanded. A new transcription of the diary by Mynors Bright appeared in six volumes, comprising about eighty per cent of the full text, between 1875 and 1879. Following the death of Bright in 1883, a further version of his transcription, edited by H B Wheatley, was published in ten volumes between 1893 and 1899. Wheatley's version represented about ninety per cent of the diary, with most of the omissions being made in line with what was considered decent in nineteenth century Britain. The full diary was finally published as \"The Diary of Samuel Pepys, a New and Complete Transcription\", edited by Robert Latham and William Matthews, running to eleven volumes, including extensive commentary, between 1970 and 1983. Matthews died in 1976 before this labour of love was completed. Latham subsequently edited \"The Shorter Pepys\", a single volume condensation of the edition he had worked on with Matthews, containing about a third of the text of the diary, which was published in 1985. This was reissued in 2003 as \"The Diary of Samuel Pepys: A Selection\", and provides the most accessible version of the diary. </p>\n<p>I follow in the footsteps of Pepys as somebody who writes a regular diary, and share his interest in government administration, being a former civil servant, and current local government officer. My civil service career lasted a mere nine months, during 1996 and 1997, when I worked for the Intervention Board, an offshoot of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Intervention Board, which was based in Reading, and has since been converted into the Rural Payments Agency, administered the European Union's infamous Common Agricultural Policy. I arrived a few weeks after the EU banned the export of British beef, due to the effects of BSE. With the BSE crisis dominating the organisation's activity at the time, staff referred to the Intervention Board as the Ministry of Mad Cows.</p>\n<p>Three hundred and twenty four years after the opening of Pepys' journal, I started my diary on the first day of 1984. Two years later I read a commentary on Pepys' work, in \"A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries\" by Thomas Mallon (published 1984). This was followed in 1988 by my reading numerous passages by Pepys in \"The Faber Book of Diaries\", edited by Simon Brett (published 1987). Having enjoyed these introductions to Pepys, I planned to read more of his diary, but must admit that for many years I was daunted by the length of the work. After all, the drastic edit that is Latham's single volume edition has a text that runs to over a thousand pages. I acquired a copy of Latham's 2003 version of Pepys' diary four years after its appearance, and began reading it early in 2008. A few months later, I am still reading Samuel Pepys' diary. On most days I enjoy the routine of reading a few of Pepys' diary entries, normally late in the evening, as supper is followed by bed. </p>",

            "title": "'The Plot Against Pepys' by James Long and Ben Long", 
            "text": "The year is 1678 and the horrific news of the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey has caused panic in England. An oddly mysterious stranger who meets the description of a suspect in the murder moving through town calls himself \"Godfrey\" which arouses suspicion. When that man slips out of town via the port of Gravesend, Sam, acting outside of his naval capacity and in his role as Justice of the Peace for Kent, finds himself investigating that man, who is later found out to be John Scott. A search of Scott's belongings raises suspicions as among his possessions is a document which Sam himself had written for Parliament, detailing the costs and strengths of England's army and navy. A warrant for Scott is issued to arrest him once he steps foot back onto English soil.  What Sam has no way of knowing is that he has now crossed paths with a very vengeful narcissistic scam artist who is linked to the Duke of Buckingham and other perpetrators of the larger Popish Plots. Sam has become an unwitting target of the Plot. \n\nFirst Sam's clerk, Sam Atkins is arrested on phony charges surrounding Godfrey's murder with the hopes that he would be intimidated by the charges and persuaded to incriminate Pepys. While Atkins refuses to bend to pressure, Pepys sets out to defend his clerk and finds a solid alibi for him on the night of the murder. Atkins is freed. The first step towards Sam is sidestepped, but not for long. The ante is upped and Sam Pepys and Sir Anthony Deane are targeted and arrested shortly thereafter.\n\nThe charges against Pepys and Deane include providing information to the French (treason), piracy, and in Pepys' case, being a Catholic. Sam's accuser on the treason charges is none other than the mystery man, John Scott. The piracy charge (more directed toward Deane) is brought by Captain Moore and the accusations of being a Catholic come from a former servant of Sam's, John James. After his arrest, Sam is imprisoned and left to unravel the mysteries of the men behind the charges and their motives for bringing them forward. From his cell, Sam is left to rely on his network of friends, professional and political contacts (many of whom must work undercover so as not to be associated with an accused traitor), and (something of a delight to the daily readers of the Diary) his brother-in-law Balty. Sam, focusing on the treason charge which could cost him his life, sets his \"spies\" on divergent paths to ferret out the man behind the charges. This probe reveals an incredibly fascinating, yet highly self-aggrandizing power hungry accuser. John Scott emerges as a despised double-crossing scam artist who, luckily for Sam, has left a path of vengeance seeking victims behind in his wake. The life of John Scott, his incredibly profuse scams and movements throughout many different countries, is incredibly detailed and tracked. These two men, only a year apart in age and both from simple backgrounds are amazing contrasts, pitted against each other in a fight for Sam's life. Like watching a game of chess with changing strategies and movements, Sam reveals the fruition of his maturity and detail-oriented analytical abilities which are incredibly challenged by Scott's unprecedented ego and cunningly scheming mind.\n\nLong and Long introduce myriad of people and details, lay out the connections and then beautifully draw it all together to make perfect sense. It was helpful for me to have a pad and pen by my side while reading to note the different people that Sam interacts with during his discovery process in order to keep them all straight. In many ways this book resembles an intricately crafted spy novel. It should be noted that James Long (the father of the team) has written historical novels before.  As the details unfold I found myself astonished by Scott's sly character and kept having to remind myself that he was a \"real person\". His exploits brings credence to the saying that truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nTo see our \"hero\" Sam enduring this situation as a mature adult was also noteworthy. During the years of the Diary we see him as he is growing, becoming aware of the politics around him, making mistakes, forming friendships and \"learning the ropes\". The plot brings to light details of the adult he has become and someone who has clearly grown in the ranks of the Navy, politics, court life, etc. to be an astute \"player\" as opposed to an observer. He also taps into an incredible network of connections including the Duke of York, a Secretary of State, French Embassy contacts, MPs, government espionage experts, Dutch investigators, wealthy merchants, and assorted 'lifetime' diplomats with a wealth of their own connections on loan to Sam. Most heartwarming, to me,  was to see the devoted support he received from Will Hewer who had come a long way from the days that Sam scolded him in the Diary for his immature errant behavior. \n\nThe authors infer to, but do not include, the actual letters of instruction that Sam wrote to his vast connections during this time. Sam's instructions to Balty during his investigative research in Paris are found in Helen Heath's <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and His Family Circle</cite>. The only thing that I wholeheartedly share in bemoaning along with the authors is that none of Balty's letters to Sam during his time in Paris are known to exist. We can only wonder at the missing melodrama that must have added to Sam's stress during this time! \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book! Hopefully as others read it they can add their annotations and commentary to share with our fellow Pepysians.\n\n_The book is published today by Faber and Faber in the UK, in hardback (480 pages).

            "text_html": "<p>The year is 1678 and the horrific news of the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey has caused panic in England. An oddly mysterious stranger who meets the description of a suspect in the murder moving through town calls himself \"Godfrey\" which arouses suspicion. When that man slips out of town via the port of Gravesend, Sam, acting outside of his naval capacity and in his role as Justice of the Peace for Kent, finds himself investigating that man, who is later found out to be John Scott. A search of Scott's belongings raises suspicions as among his possessions is a document which Sam himself had written for Parliament, detailing the costs and strengths of England's army and navy. A warrant for Scott is issued to arrest him once he steps foot back onto English soil.  What Sam has no way of knowing is that he has now crossed paths with a very vengeful narcissistic scam artist who is linked to the Duke of Buckingham and other perpetrators of the larger Popish Plots. Sam has become an unwitting target of the Plot. </p>\n<p>First Sam's clerk, Sam Atkins is arrested on phony charges surrounding Godfrey's murder with the hopes that he would be intimidated by the charges and persuaded to incriminate Pepys. While Atkins refuses to bend to pressure, Pepys sets out to defend his clerk and finds a solid alibi for him on the night of the murder. Atkins is freed. The first step towards Sam is sidestepped, but not for long. The ante is upped and Sam Pepys and Sir Anthony Deane are targeted and arrested shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>The charges against Pepys and Deane include providing information to the French (treason), piracy, and in Pepys' case, being a Catholic. Sam's accuser on the treason charges is none other than the mystery man, John Scott. The piracy charge (more directed toward Deane) is brought by Captain Moore and the accusations of being a Catholic come from a former servant of Sam's, John James. After his arrest, Sam is imprisoned and left to unravel the mysteries of the men behind the charges and their motives for bringing them forward. From his cell, Sam is left to rely on his network of friends, professional and political contacts (many of whom must work undercover so as not to be associated with an accused traitor), and (something of a delight to the daily readers of the Diary) his brother-in-law Balty. Sam, focusing on the treason charge which could cost him his life, sets his \"spies\" on divergent paths to ferret out the man behind the charges. This probe reveals an incredibly fascinating, yet highly self-aggrandizing power hungry accuser. John Scott emerges as a despised double-crossing scam artist who, luckily for Sam, has left a path of vengeance seeking victims behind in his wake. The life of John Scott, his incredibly profuse scams and movements throughout many different countries, is incredibly detailed and tracked. These two men, only a year apart in age and both from simple backgrounds are amazing contrasts, pitted against each other in a fight for Sam's life. Like watching a game of chess with changing strategies and movements, Sam reveals the fruition of his maturity and detail-oriented analytical abilities which are incredibly challenged by Scott's unprecedented ego and cunningly scheming mind.</p>\n<p>Long and Long introduce myriad of people and details, lay out the connections and then beautifully draw it all together to make perfect sense. It was helpful for me to have a pad and pen by my side while reading to note the different people that Sam interacts with during his discovery process in order to keep them all straight. In many ways this book resembles an intricately crafted spy novel. It should be noted that James Long (the father of the team) has written historical novels before.  As the details unfold I found myself astonished by Scott's sly character and kept having to remind myself that he was a \"real person\". His exploits brings credence to the saying that truth is stranger than fiction.</p>\n<p>To see our \"hero\" Sam enduring this situation as a mature adult was also noteworthy. During the years of the Diary we see him as he is growing, becoming aware of the politics around him, making mistakes, forming friendships and \"learning the ropes\". The plot brings to light details of the adult he has become and someone who has clearly grown in the ranks of the Navy, politics, court life, etc. to be an astute \"player\" as opposed to an observer. He also taps into an incredible network of connections including the Duke of York, a Secretary of State, French Embassy contacts, MPs, government espionage experts, Dutch investigators, wealthy merchants, and assorted 'lifetime' diplomats with a wealth of their own connections on loan to Sam. Most heartwarming, to me,  was to see the devoted support he received from Will Hewer who had come a long way from the days that Sam scolded him in the Diary for his immature errant behavior. </p>\n<p>The authors infer to, but do not include, the actual letters of instruction that Sam wrote to his vast connections during this time. Sam's instructions to Balty during his investigative research in Paris are found in Helen Heath's <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and His Family Circle</cite>. The only thing that I wholeheartedly share in bemoaning along with the authors is that none of Balty's letters to Sam during his time in Paris are known to exist. We can only wonder at the missing melodrama that must have added to Sam's stress during this time! </p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Hopefully as others read it they can add their annotations and commentary to share with our fellow Pepysians.</p>\n<p><em>The book is published today by Faber and Faber in the UK, in hardback (480 pages).

The men and women that he writes of have been uniquely recorded and preserved for prosperity. Years before Sam kept his diary, on a small island that lies between England and France, another diarist, the Jersey born, Jean Chevalier, kept a diary of his own. In the book, <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times</cite><sup id=\"ref1\"><a href=\"#note1\">1</a></sup> the author Arthur Charles Saunders tells us that Chevalier was the \"Pepys\" of the island, and that \"self\",  which is so significant in Sam's diary, is very minor in this diary. Quite like Sam, Chevalier was very interested in \"his fellow men and, as incident followed incident during those eight troublous years 1643 - 1651\" (Saunders, p. 13.) he recorded the details: </p>", 
            "title": "Carteret and the King", 
            "text": "> He had good descriptive powers although it is sometimes difficult to read his diary, written as it is, more or less in the patois of the Island, and, as we read page after page, we get before us a panoramic mental view of the great events which occupied the attention of the Jerseymen of that period. In 1651 the diary stopped and we have no definitive knowledge as to why it was not continued, except that Jean was a strong Royalist and, after the year 1651, members of the Royalist party had to walk very warily and it was dangerous for anyone to continue a diary in which the Parliamentary party would meet with no favour.\n\n(Saunders, p. 13).\n\nWithin his pages, Chevalier left behind a wonderful picture of the great doings of those stormy times. He divided his diary into 3 parts: \"Gouvernement de Sir Phelipe Carteret\"; \"Gouvernement de lisle de Luytent Lidcot lauthorite du Plement\"; and \"the reduction of the Island by Captaine Carteret authorisay de sa Majeste\" (Saunders, p. 40). As we collectively explore the character of the men of Sam's world, one of those men, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/\">Sir George Carteret</a>, is a key person in both diaries.\n\nExploring Carteret's long relationship with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">King Charles</a>, whom he met as a young prince in exile, brings a broadened understanding of the unique relationship that Carteret and the King have brought forward into Sam's world. This relationship is one of the rare \"lifetime\" relationships that Charles steadfastly and faithfully maintained. The foundation for that relationship was clearly established during Carteret's years as the Governor of the Isle of Jersey. Carteret was a relentless, loyal supporter of both <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/\">Charles I</a> and Charles II and served both men with an unmatched steadfast allegiance. \n\nCarteret, a Jerseyman from birth, was born on 6th May in either 1609 or 1610, the son of Elizabeth and Elie de Carteret. He left school at an early age and took to the sea, becoming a lieutenant in the King's Navy in 1629 and progressing rapidly. In 1638 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral and made an expedition to Sallee, a pirate stronghold where he freed and recovered over 270 English slaves during his naval activities. During a follow on assignment to Sallee, Carteret kept a journal, now printed as <cite>The Barbary Voyage of 1638</cite>. In 1639 he was made Comptroller of the Navy. In 1640 he lost both of his parents, but later that year found a lifetime of fulfillment when on the 16th May he was married at Mont Orgueil Castle to his cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/\">Elizabeth</a>, the daughter of Sir Philip de Carteret, Bailiff of Jersey. The young couple resided in the Navy Office in Seething Lane. His first son was born on 20th September, 1642. \n\nIn addition to his extensive sea experience, some characteristics of Carteret included his striking ability to plan ahead, assess complex strategic situations and consistently display exceptional organizational talents, often under pressure. Carteret was also well known to be highly inventive in terms of creating capital for himself and was very conscious of getting what he considered to be his \"just due\", which unfortunately often angered others.<sup id=\"ref2\">[2](#note2)</sup> In spite of his strong accumulation tendencies it must be noted that he was extremely generous to those in his \"fold\" as this lovely excerpt from a 1639  letter to Elizabeth, whom he was courting at the time, shows us:\n\n> This day I landed the Earl of Leicester at Dieppe, who has given me a chain of gold. How much it is worth I do now know; but, such as it is, I give it to my dear Betty. If you think fit, I will sell it and put the money into a collar of pearls, or you shall have it as it is.\n\n(Balleine, p. 18). <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6851/\">Edward Hyde</a> (later the Lord Chancellor of Sam's diary), would record in his <cite>History</cite>, much of which he wrote during his stay at Jersey, that he and his friends would often go to the \"castle to Sir George Carteret; who treated them with extraordinary kindness and civility, and spent much time with them\" (Ollard, <cite>Clarendon</cite>,  p. 114). In terms of generosity, the Prince of Wales, who later became King Charles II, was clearly well established within the \"fold\" of Carteret. In addition, Carteret was a strongly devoted husband and father with an upright sense of moral conduct, winning the approval of the likes of Hyde.\n\nFrom the beginning of Chevalier's diary, Parliamentary forces were fighting for control of Jersey. After the death of his Uncle Philip, Carteret, who had been appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the island returned to Jersey and reconquered the island from Parliament. On 5 February 1644 he required that \"all persons between the ages of fifteen and sixteen, who had not already done so, should take the oath of loyalty to His Majesty\" (Saunders, p. 75). He then proceeded to take measures that the island should be able to defend itself, and made it into a strategic privateering base.   For the first 5 months of his position, Carteret's privateers were at risk of being hanged. They were clearly violating International Law as they practiced without the necessary Letter of Marque. In December of 1644, \n\n> the King regularized their status by appointing Carteret \"Vice-Admiral in the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Alderney, and the maritime parts adjacent.\" An imposing parchment in barbarous Latin conferred on him jurisdiction over all things on or in the sea, including, not only ships and men, but \"whales, porpoises, dolphins, riggs, grampuses, and all other fish that by reason of their size have by ancient custom been held to appertain to the High Admiral.\" This important clause was the one that gave him the power to issue Letters of Marque and so to make his little fleet part of the Royal Navy. The licensed piracy was so profitable that Carteret was not only able to meet all the expenses of the castles, but also to lay the foundation of an exceedingly large private fortune.\n\n(Balleine, p. 54).\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales was on the move. With Parliament closing in on him, the young Prince had been forced to flee the Scilly Islands for his safety and went to Jersey, where Carteret maintained complete command over the Jersey bays. During the Prince's stay and in spite of the strain on the small island, Carteret and all Jersey folk handled this situation with utmost consideration. The Prince's safety was maintained at all times and Carteret ensured that the Prince, housed at Elizabeth Castle with his Council, received the dignity of Royal protocol \"Jersey-Style\", and that guests were graciously provided for. These assorted sections of Balleine's biography of Carteret, many based on Chevalier's diary, give us an indication of life in Jersey while the Prince was their guest (pp. 42-45): \n\n> It was only an hour before sunset, and Carteret had to face the problem of finding accommodation for three hundred uninvited guests. The Prince and Lords in Waiting were given rooms in the Castle; and horsemen rode to all parts of the island seeking lodgings for the rest. Even Hyde, though one of the four Councilors, and Fanshawe, the Prince's Secretary, had to be content with beds in Town. \"We quartered\", wrote Lady Fanshawe, \"at a widow's house in the Market Place, a stocking-merchant.\"  \n\n> Though here we have a definite case of Royalty on the run, the pomp and pageantry of the Whitehall ritual were still punctiliously adhered to. There was a galaxy of Court officials, gentlemen ushers, gentlemen of the privy chamber, grooms of the bedchamber, pages of honour, pages of the backstairs, a master of the robes, a gentleman carver and a cup bearer.\n\n> The Proud Black Eagle [ship carrying the Prince from the Scilly Island] had brought a dazzling display of silver-gilt plate to the island, and this was spread on the table whenever the Prince dined. The boy sat in solitary state with a Doctor of Divinity standing on his right to boom forth a Latin grace. On his left the elderly Lords in Waiting stood gravely in a group. A page presented on bended knee a silver bowl for rinsing the royal hands. Kneeling squires offered dishes one by one, and the gentleman-carver cut a portion from those which the Prince had selected, tasted it himself to prove that it had not been poisoned, and then laid it before him. The wine was served by a boy cup-bearer who first sipped it himself, and, as the Prince drank, held a basin under his chin, lest a drop should soil his clothes.\n\n> When Charles rode across the sands in the Town Church on Sunday, a hundred horsemen went before him; three hundred musketeers followed with drums beating. His chair was placed in front of the pulpit, and the table provided for his books was covered with rose petals. The floor around his seat was sprinkled with sweet-smelling herbs. The senior Commissioner stood at his elbow to point out the passages in the Bible to which the preacher referred.\n\n> More to Charles' taste probably was a gift that Carteret gave him. He had already shown a love of seamanship, and on the voyage from Scilly he had stood for many hours at the helm. So Sir George procured for him from St. Malo a gaily painted, two-masted pinnacle with twelve pairs of oars. He now spent most of his spare time sailing up and down St. Aubin's Bay, and he would allow no one else to touch the tiller.\n\nDuring his stay, celebrations included rejoicings, bonfires and the Royal Standard flying for the first time from Elizabeth Castle. A Grand Review was held on St. Aubin's sand with firing of guns and beating of drums, and shouts of \"long live the Prince\" which Charles acknowledged by raising his hat. \n\n> All the officers were graciously presented to the Prince and, on their knees, were graciously allowed to kiss the Prince's hand. Then volleys were fired by the musketeers and two shots were fired from each parish gun, and the Prince, after having passed through the lines of troops, left a large gratuity to be divided among the soldiers, and retired with his followers to Elizabeth Castle.\n\n(Saunders, p. 110). On the 24th of April the Prince of Wales knighted Captain George Carteret and presented him with a patent as Baronet. \n\n\nTrue to form, the Prince may have left behind another \"gift\" to the island as he kept himself busy with non-official activities.  Island gossip was that he impregnated a Jersey maiden, who later gave birth to a son named, James de la Cloche du Bourg de Jersey.  \n\n> In a letter from King Charles II in 1665 he acknowledged James as his natural son and described his mother as \"A young lady who was among the most distinguished on our Kingdom, more from frailty of our first youth than from any intention or great depravity.\" \n\n(Saunders, p. 113).\n\nWith the Queen mother, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Henrietta</a>, directing her son to come immediately to France, the Prince's stay only lasted until June 1646.  Before he left, the Prince sent a letter to \"Our Trusty and well-beloved States of Jersey\" dated 22 June 1646:\n\n> Trusty and welbeloved we cannot before our departure hence -- 24th June, 1646 -- but Express ye great sence and acknowledgement we have of ye Extraordinary proofes we have found during our Residence here of the good affeccons of ye Inhabitans of this Island to the Crown and to our Person, assuring you hereby that we shall Embrace and seeke all opportunitie to testiffie ye same By ye most reall wayes and so much we desire you in our name to make knowne to ye Islanders which shall make Good upon all occasions.\n\n(Saunders, pp. 118-119).\n\n\nWhen the Prince arrived at France, he deeply regretted ever leaving the Isle of Jersey.  He left behind his popularity, support, financing, and the loyal zealous team under Carteret. With his focus turned away from protecting the Prince's person, Carteret turned his attention back to protecting the island and fortifying the Fort of St. Aubin and Elizabeth Castle. Over the next few years an infuriated Parliament made attempts to quell the island and bring it under their control, but Carteret vehemently resisted and remained loyal to the King, whom he corresponded with during this time. In May 1647 when news reached Jersey that a small Parliamentarian army, which had been destined to take over the island had been moved elsewhere, Carteret, allowed for the disloyal residents to leave the island for France. Chevalier tells us that \"Les nouvelles vindrent \u00e0 Sire Gorge q Dieu avoit este rapellez\" (Saunders, p. 124) and for awhile Carteret was better able to focus on preparations without worries of infighting.\n   \n\nCarteret maintained the Royalist Cause battling off Parliamentarian ships with a steadfast determination and established himself and his privateers as much hated targets of Parliament. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/\">Cromwell</a> was gaining power and Parliament was making some headway. By May 1647, the political winds had changed and the King of France, now influenced by Parliament, issued a decree calling for these privateers to be declared Pirates. This action was a severe blow to the Jersey privateers who had allowed for Carteret to finance many of his expenses to fortify and defend the island as he supported the Stuart cause. It says much for Carteret that outwardly he maintained the appearance of a\n\n> successful man determined to continue his fight for the cause he loved so well. Some writers have given this world the impression that Carteret was a hard, selfish and unscrupulous man only too ready to take every opportunity to cruelly oppress and rob his opponents, but a study of the Lieutenant-Governor, especially when things appeared to have been going against him, shows him up in a better light and few men of that time, or of any time, would have been able to do what he did for his King during those strenuous and dangerous year 1643 -1651, when he had so many powerful enemies in England working for his downfall, and there was so much suspected treachery among some of the Islanders who were only awaiting a favourable opportunity to bring the island under the control of Parliament. He was a great man and a great organizer and now that the privateering days were restricted he still fought on, and not only fought on but carried the war into the enemy's camp.\n\n(Saunders, pp. 128-129).    \n\nHyde, in a letter to Hopton (another devoted Royalist), wrote:\n\n> The sudden revoking of all commissions at sea, without giving Sir George any notice, has much disturbed him; for these good fellows cost him nothing, and were a great part of his strength. Though the promiscuous granting of commissions to men of all nations might be very scandalous, and was very inconvenient to the island, they all going under the name of Jersey men-of-war, when they never came hither nor brought one penny to the place, yet to suppress those who attend this place, when the inhabitants suffer every day by Parliament, is, methinks, to bind their hands and take away the only weapon by which they can infest their neighbours.\n\n(Balleine, p. 56).\n\nIn 1647 both Carteret and Hyde received letters from King Charles I urging them to \"show patience under the trials which God was laying upon him and them, and assured them that soon he hoped to announce the signing of a righteous peace\" (Balleine, p. 63). With a show of genuine support for Jersey outwardly, Charles I, in his effort to try to free himself,  \"had agreed to terms, which contained the clause 'that Sir George Carteret and other notorious delinquents be banished this Kingdom for life, and their estates sequestered for three years, and after three years settled on their posterity\" (Balleine, p. 64). Carteret never discovered the King's disloyalty to him and remained his steadfast supporter. When the news of the execution of Charles I became known in Jersey, Parliament also issued a warning that stated that \"any person who shall presume to proclaim Charles Stuart, commonly called the Prince of Wales, to be King shall be deemed a traitor and suffer accordingly\" (Balleine, p. 71). An undaunted Carteret set forth a proclamation defying Parliament and boldly declared Charles II as the new King. As Carteret declared, \"Long Live Charles II,\" the attending Islanders \"took up the cry and, to show their loyalty, threw their hats in the air, and drums and trumpets helped to add to the enthusiasm of the crowd\" (Saunders, p. 146). \n\nThe prohibition against Carteret's Jersey privateering ended abruptly. The Prince, now the declared King, \"sent Carteret a bundle of Letters of Marque, signed by himself in ink, with a blank for the names of the captain and boat left for Carteret to fill in, and soon once more, Jersey privateers were making the Channel dangerous for ships flying Cromwell's flag\" (Balleine, p. 57). An extract from one of these letters, signed by Charles II, follows (Balleine, p. 57):\n\n> Know that we, reposing trust and confidence in your courage, experience in sea affairs, a good affection to Us, do by these presents nominate and appoint you Captain of the good ship ..........................., giving you authority with your ship manned, equipped, and armed for war, to enter any River or Port of England, and, either there or at sea, to apprehend and possess, and in the case of resistance to sink, fire, or otherwise destroy, all ships together with their men, goods, and lading, belonging to any place or person of our subjects in actual rebellion against, or not in present obedience to Us, together with the ships, persons, and goods, of all their aiders and abettors. \n\n> And to bring all ships, persons and merchandize as you shall take, without breaking the bulk or altering the property of any of the said goods, to our Island of Jersey, there to cause the same to be adjudged lawful prize by such Judge of the Admiralty as is settled there, and after such adjudication to pay the tenths and fifteenths to Our use to such person as shall have authority to receive the same.\n\n> Provided that you do not permit any injury to be done to any ships belonging to subjects of any Prince or State in league or amity with Us,\n\n> And that you make the Isle of Jersey the constant place of your abode, and obey the orders of the Governor there, whilst you enjoy the benefits our this Our commission,\n\n> Provided that you enter into bond of one thousand pounds sterling to Us for the performance of all these particulars. \n\n> CHARLES R\n\nIn addition to this naval win for Carteret, he received a highly unexpected prize. The execution of King Charles I caused considerable discontent within the Navy. One of their frigates, the \"Heart\" changed sides and, to the surprise of all, arrived at Jersey. Carteret, not one to miss an opportunity, took advantage of the fact that nobody knew this change of loyalties had occurred. He sent the Heart off to Guernsey to capture another ship, the \"Secant\". The crew of the Secant, unknowing that the Heart had pledged their loyalty to the King, was an easy target and the captured ship and its prizes went to Jersey. An unusual characteristic of Carteret is revealed here. Although he did \"imprison the Jerseymen and Guernseymen on board, he sent the others to St. Malo and gave each of them a piece of eight so that they might be able to pay their expenses in getting back to England\" (Saunders, p. 149).\n\nCarteret's requirement for oaths of loyalty to the King continued, as did the privateering. Carteret, in his wisdom, continued to make surprise visits throughout the island to check on the defenses and their upkeep. In June of 1649 Carteret received a mandate from the King to attend to him in Paris. While away, Carteret was disheartened to hear that the Heart had been captured by a Parliament ship. He returned however, with the uplifting news that The King, so impressed by the loyalty of his island subjects, had decided to spend the winter of 1649-1650 on the island. King Charles arrived there with the Duke of York and an entourage of about 300. Jersey had now become headquarters for the Royalist party. Unlike the previous trip Chevalier has recorded, this trip included many more prominent people than the group previously accompanying Charles. This trip also differed from the previous as Charles was now 19 years of age and no longer under the control of his mother. \n\nDuring his stay, Charles and the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Duke of York</a> visited the forts, fished, attended church and other somewhat relaxed activities.  \"For the winter of 1649-50 Charles was thus free from pressure. Ireland had fallen through. Rupert was in Lisbon, Hyde in Madrid, Montrose in Scandinavia, the Queen in offended dudgeon. There was nothing much to do, a situation by no means disagreeable to his taste\" (Ollard, <cite>Image</cite>, p. 74). Throughout this time, aided by the skillful sea services of Carteret's privateers, Charles maintained considerable correspondence with the mainland and his faithful followers. During a Grand Review on October 31, the King knighted Carteret's son Philip [whom we shall meet again in Sam's diary, with a completely charming anecdote, involving a daughter of Lord Sandwich]. \n\nCharles corresponded and often met with his advisors throughout this time, and it was decided that he would eventually leave for Scotland. On 11 February 1650 Charles granted Carteret an island off the coast of Virginia called Smith Island. Two days later Charles left for Holland, and appointed his brother, the Duke of York, Governor of Jersey. Upon leaving the island the King made this promise to Carteret:\n\n> Carteret, I will add this to you under my owne hand that I can never forgett the good services you have done to my father &amp; to me and, if god bless me, you shall find I doe remember them to the advantage of you and yours; and for this you have the word of your very loving freind.   Charles R.\n\n(Ollard, <cite>Image</cite>, p. 73.)\n\n> Chevalier tells that, at the King's second departure from the Island, the people did not grieve so much as they had done the first time and he tells us that the Jersey people fully expected that he was now starting on an expedition, which would, with the aid of his Scotch subjects, result in his regaining his throne of his ancestors and they all united in wishing him every success.\n\n(Saunders, p. 170.) Tensions continued to grow within the Channels.\n\nCharles was declared King of Scotland on 1 January 1651. Cromwell had defeated the Scotch Army at Dunbar and the Royal Forces at Worcester, leaving Charles to flee to Normandy.  Parliament now set their sights on Jersey. Carteret fortified the island for battle. On the 20th of October, a fleet sent was under the command of the highly distinguished Admiral Blake with approximately 3,000 troops to take over the island. Slowly the forces under Blake made headway with the surrender of Mont Orgueil castle on the 25th and the siege of Elizabeth Castle (where Carteret was located). With Elizabeth Castle in a hopeless situation the parties spent over a week to negotiate the terms of surrender. The surrender took place on 15 December 1651. A summary of the terms of the surrender follows (Balleine, pp. 98-99):\n\n> 1. All the garrison should receive free pardon for acts done during the War.\n> 2. Carteret and his two widowed sisters should retain their estates in the island without paying any composition.\n> 3. The rest of the garrison might retain their estates on paying a composition of not more than two years' value of them. \n> 4. Members of the garrison might live quietly in Jersey, if they swore to commit no further hostile acts against Parliament; of, if they chose to live overseas, they might draw the revenue from their estates as freely as those who remained in the island; and those who desired to sell should have liberty to do so.\n> 5. All who decided to go to France should be provided with vessels by Parliament.\n> 6. Prisoners of war on either side should be liberated.\n> 7. The sick and wounded should be nursed in the Castle until restored to health.\n> 8. The garrison should march out on 15th December with full honours of war, colours flying, drums beating, fuses lit at both ends, and bullets in mouth.\n> 9. Free passes were promised to anyone who wanted to go to America\n> 10. A secret clause stated that Carteret was to receive &pound;1,800 sterling. This was a common custom during such situations.\n\n\nAs Chevalier's diary ended in 1651, Balleine's biography of Carteret best sums up the next few years of his exile. The next day Carteret set sail for France and maintained his support of Charles II to the best of his ability.  His whereabouts during much of this time is sketchy as he was not a great man of letters. With his considerable knowledge of ship building he was given the job of Superintendent of the French shipyards earning a salary of 1,200 pistoles a year. He also continued his privateering activities on a much more limited basis. When Mazarin entered into an agreement with Cromwell against Spain, Carteret pondered schemes to recapture Jersey. The British Ambassador was sent to France with instructions to have Carteret extradited back to England or have him imprisoned. Carteret was imprisoned in the Bastille, without ever having been publicly charged with anything and remained there until the end of 1657. After the death of Cromwell, Carteret, whose shipbuilding skills had proved quite impressive to the French, found himself back in the ship yards at Brest. \n\nThe Restoration of Charles II was soon to follow. Ollard tells us that for once, a Stuart held true to their word (<cite>Image</cite>, pp. 73-74) [slight historical spoiler]:\n\n> The promise [of the letter given Carteret in 1650] was fully honoured. At the Restoration Carteret was rewarded with the Treasuryship of the Navy, one of the most lucrative posts in the government. When the disasters of the Second Dutch War exposed the Navy Board to the avenging fury of the House of Commons the Treasurer was enabled to exchange offices with the Deputy Treasurer of Ireland<sup id=\"ref3\">[3](#note3)</sup>, another of the most coveted jobs in the administration. The ingratitude so often charged against the Stuarts is notably absent from Charles II's treatment of this brave and loyal servant. Pepys, a sharp and often malicious critic of his colleagues, praises Carteret for his good nature, his diligence and his honesty. As host to the young King and his brother he was as generous as his credit and the profits of his privateers would allow. Best of all no doubt was his lack of political standing and ambition. His sympathies lay with Hyde and Hopton to whom he had given shelter four years earlier, but he was essentially an executive, content to carry out policy rather than frame one.\n\nA.C. Saunders, offers this character sketch of Carteret, during his Jersey years: \n\n> There was not much sentiment about George Carteret. He knew what he wanted and was determined to get it. A great sailor and a faithful servant to the King and the Royal Cause, he realized that, when he became Lieutenant-Governor and had taken up duties in the Island, he would be in a very dangerous position, and that if he failed, the Parliamentarians would show him little mercy. He was a much stronger character than his uncle, the late Sir Philip [who had role prior to him], but had the same accumulative tendencies and was very fond of power and riches and, later on, was known in England as the rich Sir George. He was very brave and had very considerable organizing ability and he allowed few scruples to interfere with his plans for the good of the cause he had at heart, and he was determined to grant stern justice to those who, during the last year of his uncle's life, had treated him so badly. The Parliamentarians had little encouragement to submit their grievances to his sense of justice. He would admit of no grievances and considered that for their past actions they deserved utmost penalties. Many fled from the Island, but during the next eight years those remaining could get little assistance or support from the English Parliament.\n \n> Sir George was all powerful in Jersey and, in all his actions, was supported by the members of the States who were always ready to follow his lead. Therefore he was always careful before taking any action in the Island to see that his conduct was in accordance with the legal procedure of the Island.\n \n> Therefore until 1651 he was the Dictator of the Island, and maintained the honour of the Royalist cause and, gathering together a number of ships and manning them with gallant mariners, he was able to spread terror among the English vessels trading to and from English ports, in the English Channel.\n\n> It is only a great man who could have done what he did in keeping the Royal Standard flying for nearly three years after the execution of Charles I, and historians in the past have done little justice to the gallant stand made by Sir George and his supporters in the little Island of Jersey, a stand which required the greatest Admiral, Blake, with seventy ships and three thousand men to put down, and then only after Sir George had been granted full honours of war. \n\n> Notwithstanding his many faults and his lack of sympathy in his dealing with opponents, who were not faultless, he may be considered as one of the greatest leaders during the Civil Wars, and the Royalist stand in Jersey as one of the great epochs in history.\" \n\n\n### Notes\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id=\"note1\"><p>Saunders' book <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times</cite> is rather rare, but may be available in the US via the public library inter-library loan program.

In March 1653, Carteret (acting on the King's behalf)  fought with Prince Rupert over the spoils from the \"Swallow\" and the two became enemies. During the years of Sam's diary, Carteret's salary, as Treasurer of the Navy often caused considerable friction as explained by Balleine (p. 123): \"Previous Treasurers' salaries had included the right to keep threepence out of every pound that passed through their hands. Carteret's however was at first fixed at around &pound;2,000 a year but, with his usual financial canniness, in 1662 he persuaded the King to revert to the old arrangement. As in peace-time the Navy cost about &pound;400,000 a year, this meant a poundage of \u00a35,000, and should the country go to war, his income would become colossal\". Sam records Carteret's argument with William Coventry, which is based on this percentage issue, in his 12 June 1662 entry. Although Carteret \"won\" this dispute he became Coventry's enemy in the process, as Sam's ongoing diary entries reveal. On several occasions, Carteret had loaned the King money as opposed to giving the King money (which other Royalists had done). Upon seeing the King repay Carteret, others, who had not been so shrewd in their financing, were highly indignant. <a href=\"#ref2\">Return</a></p></li> \n\n\t<li id=\"note3\"><p>[Spoiler] Quotes in this note are from the Balleine book. From 1666-1667 Carteret was investigated for activities related to the handling of accounts for the Dutch War. During this time Charles II steadfastly supported Carteret and used his rights as King to adjourn Parliament on several occasions in hopes that the accusations would die down. After this tactic did not prove successful, Charles made a statement that \"he had personally examined the Navy Accounts, and was satisfied that there was nothing wrong with them, and he forbad further discussion\" (p. 135). \"The Treasury Books have now been edited by Dr. William Shaw who had access to documents which the Committee never saw and he has written: 'The lasting impression which they leave is that of an active, capable, honest body of officials struggling vainly against absolutely insuperable financial difficulties\" (p. 130).  There have been no substantiated signs of cheating or embezzlement, and to the contrary, Carteret has been recorded as to digging into his own pockets to support the King and, at times naval activities on his behalf. <a href=\"#ref3\">Return</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Books consulted and/or quoted for this article\n\n* Balleine, G.R., <cite>All for the King</cite>, 1976.\n* Carteret, Sir George, <cite>The Barbary Voyage of 1638</cite>, 1929.\n* Fraser, Antonia, <cite>King Charles II</cite>, 1979.\n* Hutton, Ronald, <cite>Charles II</cite>, 1989. \n* Nelson, William, <cite>Sir George Carteret Lord Proprietor of New Jersey with a Notice of the Isle of Jersey and a Brief Sketch of Lord John Berkeley</cite>, 1893.\n* Ollard, Richard, <cite>The Image of the King</cite>, 1979.\n* Ollard, Richard, <cite>Clarendon and His Friends</cite>, 1988.\n* Saunders, A.C., <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times.

            "intro": "<p class=\"author\">By Jeannine Kerwin</p>\n\n\nSam's diary affords us the wonderful opportunity to see his world and view the individuals surrounding him through his eyes. The men and women that he writes of have been uniquely recorded and preserved for prosperity. Years before Sam kept his diary, on a small island that lies between England and France, another diarist, the Jersey born, Jean Chevalier, kept a diary of his own. In the book, <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times</cite><sup id=\"ref1\">[1](#note1)</sup> the author Arthur Charles Saunders tells us that Chevalier was the \"Pepys\" of the island, and that \"self\",  which is so significant in Sam's diary, is very minor in this diary. Quite like Sam, Chevalier was very interested in \"his fellow men and, as incident followed incident during those eight troublous years 1643 - 1651\" (Saunders, p. 13.) he recorded the details: ", 
            "text_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>He had good descriptive powers although it is sometimes difficult to read his diary, written as it is, more or less in the patois of the Island, and, as we read page after page, we get before us a panoramic mental view of the great events which occupied the attention of the Jerseymen of that period. In 1651 the diary stopped and we have no definitive knowledge as to why it was not continued, except that Jean was a strong Royalist and, after the year 1651, members of the Royalist party had to walk very warily and it was dangerous for anyone to continue a diary in which the Parliamentary party would meet with no favour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, p. 13).</p>\n<p>Within his pages, Chevalier left behind a wonderful picture of the great doings of those stormy times. He divided his diary into 3 parts: \"Gouvernement de Sir Phelipe Carteret\"; \"Gouvernement de lisle de Luytent Lidcot lauthorite du Plement\"; and \"the reduction of the Island by Captaine Carteret authorisay de sa Majeste\" (Saunders, p. 40). As we collectively explore the character of the men of Sam's world, one of those men, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/\">Sir George Carteret</a>, is a key person in both diaries.</p>\n<p>Exploring Carteret's long relationship with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">King Charles</a>, whom he met as a young prince in exile, brings a broadened understanding of the unique relationship that Carteret and the King have brought forward into Sam's world. This relationship is one of the rare \"lifetime\" relationships that Charles steadfastly and faithfully maintained. The foundation for that relationship was clearly established during Carteret's years as the Governor of the Isle of Jersey. Carteret was a relentless, loyal supporter of both <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/\">Charles I</a> and Charles II and served both men with an unmatched steadfast allegiance. </p>\n<p>Carteret, a Jerseyman from birth, was born on 6th May in either 1609 or 1610, the son of Elizabeth and Elie de Carteret. He left school at an early age and took to the sea, becoming a lieutenant in the King's Navy in 1629 and progressing rapidly. In 1638 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral and made an expedition to Sallee, a pirate stronghold where he freed and recovered over 270 English slaves during his naval activities. During a follow on assignment to Sallee, Carteret kept a journal, now printed as <cite>The Barbary Voyage of 1638</cite>. In 1639 he was made Comptroller of the Navy. In 1640 he lost both of his parents, but later that year found a lifetime of fulfillment when on the 16th May he was married at Mont Orgueil Castle to his cousin <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/\">Elizabeth</a>, the daughter of Sir Philip de Carteret, Bailiff of Jersey. The young couple resided in the Navy Office in Seething Lane. His first son was born on 20th September, 1642. </p>\n<p>In addition to his extensive sea experience, some characteristics of Carteret included his striking ability to plan ahead, assess complex strategic situations and consistently display exceptional organizational talents, often under pressure. Carteret was also well known to be highly inventive in terms of creating capital for himself and was very conscious of getting what he considered to be his \"just due\", which unfortunately often angered others.<sup id=\"ref2\"><a href=\"#note2\">2</a></sup> In spite of his strong accumulation tendencies it must be noted that he was extremely generous to those in his \"fold\" as this lovely excerpt from a 1639  letter to Elizabeth, whom he was courting at the time, shows us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This day I landed the Earl of Leicester at Dieppe, who has given me a chain of gold. How much it is worth I do now know; but, such as it is, I give it to my dear Betty. If you think fit, I will sell it and put the money into a collar of pearls, or you shall have it as it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Balleine, p. 18). <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6851/\">Edward Hyde</a> (later the Lord Chancellor of Sam's diary), would record in his <cite>History</cite>, much of which he wrote during his stay at Jersey, that he and his friends would often go to the \"castle to Sir George Carteret; who treated them with extraordinary kindness and civility, and spent much time with them\" (Ollard, <cite>Clarendon</cite>,  p. 114). In terms of generosity, the Prince of Wales, who later became King Charles II, was clearly well established within the \"fold\" of Carteret. In addition, Carteret was a strongly devoted husband and father with an upright sense of moral conduct, winning the approval of the likes of Hyde.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of Chevalier's diary, Parliamentary forces were fighting for control of Jersey. After the death of his Uncle Philip, Carteret, who had been appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the island returned to Jersey and reconquered the island from Parliament. On 5 February 1644 he required that \"all persons between the ages of fifteen and sixteen, who had not already done so, should take the oath of loyalty to His Majesty\" (Saunders, p. 75). He then proceeded to take measures that the island should be able to defend itself, and made it into a strategic privateering base.   For the first 5 months of his position, Carteret's privateers were at risk of being hanged. They were clearly violating International Law as they practiced without the necessary Letter of Marque. In December of 1644, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the King regularized their status by appointing Carteret \"Vice-Admiral in the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Alderney, and the maritime parts adjacent.\" An imposing parchment in barbarous Latin conferred on him jurisdiction over all things on or in the sea, including, not only ships and men, but \"whales, porpoises, dolphins, riggs, grampuses, and all other fish that by reason of their size have by ancient custom been held to appertain to the High Admiral.\" This important clause was the one that gave him the power to issue Letters of Marque and so to make his little fleet part of the Royal Navy. The licensed piracy was so profitable that Carteret was not only able to meet all the expenses of the castles, but also to lay the foundation of an exceedingly large private fortune.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Balleine, p. 54).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales was on the move. With Parliament closing in on him, the young Prince had been forced to flee the Scilly Islands for his safety and went to Jersey, where Carteret maintained complete command over the Jersey bays. During the Prince's stay and in spite of the strain on the small island, Carteret and all Jersey folk handled this situation with utmost consideration. The Prince's safety was maintained at all times and Carteret ensured that the Prince, housed at Elizabeth Castle with his Council, received the dignity of Royal protocol \"Jersey-Style\", and that guests were graciously provided for. These assorted sections of Balleine's biography of Carteret, many based on Chevalier's diary, give us an indication of life in Jersey while the Prince was their guest (pp. 42-45): </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was only an hour before sunset, and Carteret had to face the problem of finding accommodation for three hundred uninvited guests. The Prince and Lords in Waiting were given rooms in the Castle; and horsemen rode to all parts of the island seeking lodgings for the rest. Even Hyde, though one of the four Councilors, and Fanshawe, the Prince's Secretary, had to be content with beds in Town. \"We quartered\", wrote Lady Fanshawe, \"at a widow's house in the Market Place, a stocking-merchant.\"  </p>\n<p>Though here we have a definite case of Royalty on the run, the pomp and pageantry of the Whitehall ritual were still punctiliously adhered to. There was a galaxy of Court officials, gentlemen ushers, gentlemen of the privy chamber, grooms of the bedchamber, pages of honour, pages of the backstairs, a master of the robes, a gentleman carver and a cup bearer.</p>\n<p>The Proud Black Eagle [ship carrying the Prince from the Scilly Island] had brought a dazzling display of silver-gilt plate to the island, and this was spread on the table whenever the Prince dined. The boy sat in solitary state with a Doctor of Divinity standing on his right to boom forth a Latin grace. On his left the elderly Lords in Waiting stood gravely in a group. A page presented on bended knee a silver bowl for rinsing the royal hands. Kneeling squires offered dishes one by one, and the gentleman-carver cut a portion from those which the Prince had selected, tasted it himself to prove that it had not been poisoned, and then laid it before him. The wine was served by a boy cup-bearer who first sipped it himself, and, as the Prince drank, held a basin under his chin, lest a drop should soil his clothes.</p>\n<p>When Charles rode across the sands in the Town Church on Sunday, a hundred horsemen went before him; three hundred musketeers followed with drums beating. His chair was placed in front of the pulpit, and the table provided for his books was covered with rose petals. The floor around his seat was sprinkled with sweet-smelling herbs. The senior Commissioner stood at his elbow to point out the passages in the Bible to which the preacher referred.</p>\n<p>More to Charles' taste probably was a gift that Carteret gave him. He had already shown a love of seamanship, and on the voyage from Scilly he had stood for many hours at the helm. So Sir George procured for him from St. Malo a gaily painted, two-masted pinnacle with twelve pairs of oars. He now spent most of his spare time sailing up and down St. Aubin's Bay, and he would allow no one else to touch the tiller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During his stay, celebrations included rejoicings, bonfires and the Royal Standard flying for the first time from Elizabeth Castle. A Grand Review was held on St. Aubin's sand with firing of guns and beating of drums, and shouts of \"long live the Prince\" which Charles acknowledged by raising his hat. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the officers were graciously presented to the Prince and, on their knees, were graciously allowed to kiss the Prince's hand. Then volleys were fired by the musketeers and two shots were fired from each parish gun, and the Prince, after having passed through the lines of troops, left a large gratuity to be divided among the soldiers, and retired with his followers to Elizabeth Castle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, p. 110). On the 24th of April the Prince of Wales knighted Captain George Carteret and presented him with a patent as Baronet. </p>\n<p>True to form, the Prince may have left behind another \"gift\" to the island as he kept himself busy with non-official activities.  Island gossip was that he impregnated a Jersey maiden, who later gave birth to a son named, James de la Cloche du Bourg de Jersey.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a letter from King Charles II in 1665 he acknowledged James as his natural son and described his mother as \"A young lady who was among the most distinguished on our Kingdom, more from frailty of our first youth than from any intention or great depravity.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, p. 113).</p>\n<p>With the Queen mother, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Henrietta</a>, directing her son to come immediately to France, the Prince's stay only lasted until June 1646.  Before he left, the Prince sent a letter to \"Our Trusty and well-beloved States of Jersey\" dated 22 June 1646:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trusty and welbeloved we cannot before our departure hence -- 24th June, 1646 -- but Express ye great sence and acknowledgement we have of ye Extraordinary proofes we have found during our Residence here of the good affeccons of ye Inhabitans of this Island to the Crown and to our Person, assuring you hereby that we shall Embrace and seeke all opportunitie to testiffie ye same By ye most reall wayes and so much we desire you in our name to make knowne to ye Islanders which shall make Good upon all occasions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, pp. 118-119).</p>\n<p>When the Prince arrived at France, he deeply regretted ever leaving the Isle of Jersey.  He left behind his popularity, support, financing, and the loyal zealous team under Carteret. With his focus turned away from protecting the Prince's person, Carteret turned his attention back to protecting the island and fortifying the Fort of St. Aubin and Elizabeth Castle. Over the next few years an infuriated Parliament made attempts to quell the island and bring it under their control, but Carteret vehemently resisted and remained loyal to the King, whom he corresponded with during this time. In May 1647 when news reached Jersey that a small Parliamentarian army, which had been destined to take over the island had been moved elsewhere, Carteret, allowed for the disloyal residents to leave the island for France. Chevalier tells us that \"Les nouvelles vindrent \u00e0 Sire Gorge q Dieu avoit este rapellez\" (Saunders, p. 124) and for awhile Carteret was better able to focus on preparations without worries of infighting.</p>\n<p>Carteret maintained the Royalist Cause battling off Parliamentarian ships with a steadfast determination and established himself and his privateers as much hated targets of Parliament. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/\">Cromwell</a> was gaining power and Parliament was making some headway. By May 1647, the political winds had changed and the King of France, now influenced by Parliament, issued a decree calling for these privateers to be declared Pirates. This action was a severe blow to the Jersey privateers who had allowed for Carteret to finance many of his expenses to fortify and defend the island as he supported the Stuart cause. It says much for Carteret that outwardly he maintained the appearance of a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>successful man determined to continue his fight for the cause he loved so well. Some writers have given this world the impression that Carteret was a hard, selfish and unscrupulous man only too ready to take every opportunity to cruelly oppress and rob his opponents, but a study of the Lieutenant-Governor, especially when things appeared to have been going against him, shows him up in a better light and few men of that time, or of any time, would have been able to do what he did for his King during those strenuous and dangerous year 1643 -1651, when he had so many powerful enemies in England working for his downfall, and there was so much suspected treachery among some of the Islanders who were only awaiting a favourable opportunity to bring the island under the control of Parliament. He was a great man and a great organizer and now that the privateering days were restricted he still fought on, and not only fought on but carried the war into the enemy's camp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, pp. 128-129).    </p>\n<p>Hyde, in a letter to Hopton (another devoted Royalist), wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sudden revoking of all commissions at sea, without giving Sir George any notice, has much disturbed him; for these good fellows cost him nothing, and were a great part of his strength. Though the promiscuous granting of commissions to men of all nations might be very scandalous, and was very inconvenient to the island, they all going under the name of Jersey men-of-war, when they never came hither nor brought one penny to the place, yet to suppress those who attend this place, when the inhabitants suffer every day by Parliament, is, methinks, to bind their hands and take away the only weapon by which they can infest their neighbours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Balleine, p. 56).</p>\n<p>In 1647 both Carteret and Hyde received letters from King Charles I urging them to \"show patience under the trials which God was laying upon him and them, and assured them that soon he hoped to announce the signing of a righteous peace\" (Balleine, p. 63). With a show of genuine support for Jersey outwardly, Charles I, in his effort to try to free himself,  \"had agreed to terms, which contained the clause 'that Sir George Carteret and other notorious delinquents be banished this Kingdom for life, and their estates sequestered for three years, and after three years settled on their posterity\" (Balleine, p. 64). Carteret never discovered the King's disloyalty to him and remained his steadfast supporter. When the news of the execution of Charles I became known in Jersey, Parliament also issued a warning that stated that \"any person who shall presume to proclaim Charles Stuart, commonly called the Prince of Wales, to be King shall be deemed a traitor and suffer accordingly\" (Balleine, p. 71). An undaunted Carteret set forth a proclamation defying Parliament and boldly declared Charles II as the new King. As Carteret declared, \"Long Live Charles II,\" the attending Islanders \"took up the cry and, to show their loyalty, threw their hats in the air, and drums and trumpets helped to add to the enthusiasm of the crowd\" (Saunders, p. 146). </p>\n<p>The prohibition against Carteret's Jersey privateering ended abruptly. The Prince, now the declared King, \"sent Carteret a bundle of Letters of Marque, signed by himself in ink, with a blank for the names of the captain and boat left for Carteret to fill in, and soon once more, Jersey privateers were making the Channel dangerous for ships flying Cromwell's flag\" (Balleine, p. 57). An extract from one of these letters, signed by Charles II, follows (Balleine, p. 57):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know that we, reposing trust and confidence in your courage, experience in sea affairs, a good affection to Us, do by these presents nominate and appoint you Captain of the good ship ..........................., giving you authority with your ship manned, equipped, and armed for war, to enter any River or Port of England, and, either there or at sea, to apprehend and possess, and in the case of resistance to sink, fire, or otherwise destroy, all ships together with their men, goods, and lading, belonging to any place or person of our subjects in actual rebellion against, or not in present obedience to Us, together with the ships, persons, and goods, of all their aiders and abettors. </p>\n<p>And to bring all ships, persons and merchandize as you shall take, without breaking the bulk or altering the property of any of the said goods, to our Island of Jersey, there to cause the same to be adjudged lawful prize by such Judge of the Admiralty as is settled there, and after such adjudication to pay the tenths and fifteenths to Our use to such person as shall have authority to receive the same.</p>\n<p>Provided that you do not permit any injury to be done to any ships belonging to subjects of any Prince or State in league or amity with Us,</p>\n<p>And that you make the Isle of Jersey the constant place of your abode, and obey the orders of the Governor there, whilst you enjoy the benefits our this Our commission,</p>\n<p>Provided that you enter into bond of one thousand pounds sterling to Us for the performance of all these particulars. </p>\n<p>CHARLES R</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to this naval win for Carteret, he received a highly unexpected prize. The execution of King Charles I caused considerable discontent within the Navy. One of their frigates, the \"Heart\" changed sides and, to the surprise of all, arrived at Jersey. Carteret, not one to miss an opportunity, took advantage of the fact that nobody knew this change of loyalties had occurred. He sent the Heart off to Guernsey to capture another ship, the \"Secant\". The crew of the Secant, unknowing that the Heart had pledged their loyalty to the King, was an easy target and the captured ship and its prizes went to Jersey. An unusual characteristic of Carteret is revealed here. Although he did \"imprison the Jerseymen and Guernseymen on board, he sent the others to St. Malo and gave each of them a piece of eight so that they might be able to pay their expenses in getting back to England\" (Saunders, p. 149).</p>\n<p>Carteret's requirement for oaths of loyalty to the King continued, as did the privateering. Carteret, in his wisdom, continued to make surprise visits throughout the island to check on the defenses and their upkeep. In June of 1649 Carteret received a mandate from the King to attend to him in Paris. While away, Carteret was disheartened to hear that the Heart had been captured by a Parliament ship. He returned however, with the uplifting news that The King, so impressed by the loyalty of his island subjects, had decided to spend the winter of 1649-1650 on the island. King Charles arrived there with the Duke of York and an entourage of about 300. Jersey had now become headquarters for the Royalist party. Unlike the previous trip Chevalier has recorded, this trip included many more prominent people than the group previously accompanying Charles. This trip also differed from the previous as Charles was now 19 years of age and no longer under the control of his mother. </p>\n<p>During his stay, Charles and the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Duke of York</a> visited the forts, fished, attended church and other somewhat relaxed activities.  \"For the winter of 1649-50 Charles was thus free from pressure. Ireland had fallen through. Rupert was in Lisbon, Hyde in Madrid, Montrose in Scandinavia, the Queen in offended dudgeon. There was nothing much to do, a situation by no means disagreeable to his taste\" (Ollard, <cite>Image</cite>, p. 74). Throughout this time, aided by the skillful sea services of Carteret's privateers, Charles maintained considerable correspondence with the mainland and his faithful followers. During a Grand Review on October 31, the King knighted Carteret's son Philip [whom we shall meet again in Sam's diary, with a completely charming anecdote, involving a daughter of Lord Sandwich]. </p>\n<p>Charles corresponded and often met with his advisors throughout this time, and it was decided that he would eventually leave for Scotland. On 11 February 1650 Charles granted Carteret an island off the coast of Virginia called Smith Island. Two days later Charles left for Holland, and appointed his brother, the Duke of York, Governor of Jersey. Upon leaving the island the King made this promise to Carteret:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carteret, I will add this to you under my owne hand that I can never forgett the good services you have done to my father &amp; to me and, if god bless me, you shall find I doe remember them to the advantage of you and yours; and for this you have the word of your very loving freind.   Charles R.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Ollard, <cite>Image</cite>, p. 73.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chevalier tells that, at the King's second departure from the Island, the people did not grieve so much as they had done the first time and he tells us that the Jersey people fully expected that he was now starting on an expedition, which would, with the aid of his Scotch subjects, result in his regaining his throne of his ancestors and they all united in wishing him every success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Saunders, p. 170.) Tensions continued to grow within the Channels.</p>\n<p>Charles was declared King of Scotland on 1 January 1651. Cromwell had defeated the Scotch Army at Dunbar and the Royal Forces at Worcester, leaving Charles to flee to Normandy.  Parliament now set their sights on Jersey. Carteret fortified the island for battle. On the 20th of October, a fleet sent was under the command of the highly distinguished Admiral Blake with approximately 3,000 troops to take over the island. Slowly the forces under Blake made headway with the surrender of Mont Orgueil castle on the 25th and the siege of Elizabeth Castle (where Carteret was located). With Elizabeth Castle in a hopeless situation the parties spent over a week to negotiate the terms of surrender. The surrender took place on 15 December 1651. A summary of the terms of the surrender follows (Balleine, pp. 98-99):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>All the garrison should receive free pardon for acts done during the War.</li>\n<li>Carteret and his two widowed sisters should retain their estates in the island without paying any composition.</li>\n<li>The rest of the garrison might retain their estates on paying a composition of not more than two years' value of them. </li>\n<li>Members of the garrison might live quietly in Jersey, if they swore to commit no further hostile acts against Parliament; of, if they chose to live overseas, they might draw the revenue from their estates as freely as those who remained in the island; and those who desired to sell should have liberty to do so.</li>\n<li>All who decided to go to France should be provided with vessels by Parliament.</li>\n<li>Prisoners of war on either side should be liberated.</li>\n<li>The sick and wounded should be nursed in the Castle until restored to health.</li>\n<li>The garrison should march out on 15th December with full honours of war, colours flying, drums beating, fuses lit at both ends, and bullets in mouth.</li>\n<li>Free passes were promised to anyone who wanted to go to America</li>\n<li>A secret clause stated that Carteret was to receive &pound;1,800 sterling. This was a common custom during such situations.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Chevalier's diary ended in 1651, Balleine's biography of Carteret best sums up the next few years of his exile. The next day Carteret set sail for France and maintained his support of Charles II to the best of his ability.  His whereabouts during much of this time is sketchy as he was not a great man of letters. With his considerable knowledge of ship building he was given the job of Superintendent of the French shipyards earning a salary of 1,200 pistoles a year. He also continued his privateering activities on a much more limited basis. When Mazarin entered into an agreement with Cromwell against Spain, Carteret pondered schemes to recapture Jersey. The British Ambassador was sent to France with instructions to have Carteret extradited back to England or have him imprisoned. Carteret was imprisoned in the Bastille, without ever having been publicly charged with anything and remained there until the end of 1657. After the death of Cromwell, Carteret, whose shipbuilding skills had proved quite impressive to the French, found himself back in the ship yards at Brest. </p>\n<p>The Restoration of Charles II was soon to follow. Ollard tells us that for once, a Stuart held true to their word (<cite>Image</cite>, pp. 73-74) [slight historical spoiler]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The promise [of the letter given Carteret in 1650] was fully honoured. At the Restoration Carteret was rewarded with the Treasuryship of the Navy, one of the most lucrative posts in the government. When the disasters of the Second Dutch War exposed the Navy Board to the avenging fury of the House of Commons the Treasurer was enabled to exchange offices with the Deputy Treasurer of Ireland<sup id=\"ref3\"><a href=\"#note3\">3</a></sup>, another of the most coveted jobs in the administration. The ingratitude so often charged against the Stuarts is notably absent from Charles II's treatment of this brave and loyal servant. Pepys, a sharp and often malicious critic of his colleagues, praises Carteret for his good nature, his diligence and his honesty. As host to the young King and his brother he was as generous as his credit and the profits of his privateers would allow. Best of all no doubt was his lack of political standing and ambition. His sympathies lay with Hyde and Hopton to whom he had given shelter four years earlier, but he was essentially an executive, content to carry out policy rather than frame one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A.C. Saunders, offers this character sketch of Carteret, during his Jersey years: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was not much sentiment about George Carteret. He knew what he wanted and was determined to get it. A great sailor and a faithful servant to the King and the Royal Cause, he realized that, when he became Lieutenant-Governor and had taken up duties in the Island, he would be in a very dangerous position, and that if he failed, the Parliamentarians would show him little mercy. He was a much stronger character than his uncle, the late Sir Philip [who had role prior to him], but had the same accumulative tendencies and was very fond of power and riches and, later on, was known in England as the rich Sir George. He was very brave and had very considerable organizing ability and he allowed few scruples to interfere with his plans for the good of the cause he had at heart, and he was determined to grant stern justice to those who, during the last year of his uncle's life, had treated him so badly. The Parliamentarians had little encouragement to submit their grievances to his sense of justice. He would admit of no grievances and considered that for their past actions they deserved utmost penalties. Many fled from the Island, but during the next eight years those remaining could get little assistance or support from the English Parliament.</p>\n<p>Sir George was all powerful in Jersey and, in all his actions, was supported by the members of the States who were always ready to follow his lead. Therefore he was always careful before taking any action in the Island to see that his conduct was in accordance with the legal procedure of the Island.</p>\n<p>Therefore until 1651 he was the Dictator of the Island, and maintained the honour of the Royalist cause and, gathering together a number of ships and manning them with gallant mariners, he was able to spread terror among the English vessels trading to and from English ports, in the English Channel.</p>\n<p>It is only a great man who could have done what he did in keeping the Royal Standard flying for nearly three years after the execution of Charles I, and historians in the past have done little justice to the gallant stand made by Sir George and his supporters in the little Island of Jersey, a stand which required the greatest Admiral, Blake, with seventy ships and three thousand men to put down, and then only after Sir George had been granted full honours of war. </p>\n<p>Notwithstanding his many faults and his lack of sympathy in his dealing with opponents, who were not faultless, he may be considered as one of the greatest leaders during the Civil Wars, and the Royalist stand in Jersey as one of the great epochs in history.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ol>\n    <li id=\"note1\"><p>Saunders' book <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times</cite> is rather rare, but may be available in the US via the public library inter-library loan program.

In March 1653, Carteret (acting on the King's behalf)  fought with Prince Rupert over the spoils from the \"Swallow\" and the two became enemies. During the years of Sam's diary, Carteret's salary, as Treasurer of the Navy often caused considerable friction as explained by Balleine (p. 123): \"Previous Treasurers' salaries had included the right to keep threepence out of every pound that passed through their hands. Carteret's however was at first fixed at around &pound;2,000 a year but, with his usual financial canniness, in 1662 he persuaded the King to revert to the old arrangement. As in peace-time the Navy cost about &pound;400,000 a year, this meant a poundage of \u00a35,000, and should the country go to war, his income would become colossal\". Sam records Carteret's argument with William Coventry, which is based on this percentage issue, in his 12 June 1662 entry. Although Carteret \"won\" this dispute he became Coventry's enemy in the process, as Sam's ongoing diary entries reveal. On several occasions, Carteret had loaned the King money as opposed to giving the King money (which other Royalists had done). Upon seeing the King repay Carteret, others, who had not been so shrewd in their financing, were highly indignant. <a href=\"#ref2\">Return</a></p></li> \n\n    <li id=\"note3\"><p>[Spoiler] Quotes in this note are from the Balleine book. From 1666-1667 Carteret was investigated for activities related to the handling of accounts for the Dutch War. During this time Charles II steadfastly supported Carteret and used his rights as King to adjourn Parliament on several occasions in hopes that the accusations would die down. After this tactic did not prove successful, Charles made a statement that \"he had personally examined the Navy Accounts, and was satisfied that there was nothing wrong with them, and he forbad further discussion\" (p. 135). \"The Treasury Books have now been edited by Dr. William Shaw who had access to documents which the Committee never saw and he has written: 'The lasting impression which they leave is that of an active, capable, honest body of officials struggling vainly against absolutely insuperable financial difficulties\" (p. 130).  There have been no substantiated signs of cheating or embezzlement, and to the contrary, Carteret has been recorded as to digging into his own pockets to support the King and, at times naval activities on his behalf. <a href=\"#ref3\">Return</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Books consulted and/or quoted for this article</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Balleine, G.R., <cite>All for the King</cite>, 1976.</li>\n<li>Carteret, Sir George, <cite>The Barbary Voyage of 1638</cite>, 1929.</li>\n<li>Fraser, Antonia, <cite>King Charles II</cite>, 1979.</li>\n<li>Hutton, Ronald, <cite>Charles II</cite>, 1989. </li>\n<li>Nelson, William, <cite>Sir George Carteret Lord Proprietor of New Jersey with a Notice of the Isle of Jersey and a Brief Sketch of Lord John Berkeley</cite>, 1893.</li>\n<li>Ollard, Richard, <cite>The Image of the King</cite>, 1979.</li>\n<li>Ollard, Richard, <cite>Clarendon and His Friends</cite>, 1988.</li>\n<li>Saunders, A.C., <cite>Jean Chevalier and His Times.

            "text": "Heath tells us that \"Thomas, born 18 June 1634, took over the London tailor shop in 1661, on terms never made clear beyond the hint in the diary that he would miscarry for want of brains and care\" (p. xx).  She presents several letters (dated from April 1664 through July 1664) which include those from i) Sam to his Cozen Scott, ii) Dr. Thomas Pepys to John Sr., iii) Sam to Mr. Pearson and iv) John Sr. to Sam. These letters set forth arguments, conflicts and assorted issues about the value of Tom's estate, payments made and/or due including the funeral services costs, the accuracy of the inventory, the actual 'ownership\" of the items in the inventory, etc. As in many estate closings tempers fly, accusations are made and these letters \"record the conflicting assertions and recriminations of the persons involved. Perhaps most of the contenders were mistaken in what they thought they knew, although it seems possible that some were perjuring themselves. Samuel, in any event, was left to compose the quarrel and satisfy the law\" (p. xx). Where Sam's upcoming Diary entries will no doubt touch on these issues, the letters have not been included, but will revolve in part, around the inventory, which is dated back to 1661.\n\nHeath also explains \"That Thomas was not a financial success is no mark against his character. The inaccuracy of his book-keeping, even though regrettable, was not outstanding in an age when even the royal accounts were often confused, and when Samuel Pepys made a name for himself by an honesty and an accuracy in the public accounting that were held unprecedented\"  (p. xx).\n \nHeath's text is directly from the manuscript. This letter is from the Rawlinson Collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, located in the Admiralty volumes of the Pepysian Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Heath notes that this inventory was in the hand of Thomas Pepys and that the acknowledgement (later document in this text) was in the hand of Sam, with the signature of Thomas. It is endorsed in Sam's hand with a note that reads \"TP's bond to redd on demand\". \n\nThe formatting of the inventory does not exactly reflect the original as it appeared in Ms. Heath's collection.  The inventory content is from the original and, as is the acknowledgement letter and is presented in full. Throughout the document it appears that when Thomas writes 'on', 'i' or \"I\" he means \"one\". Heath's notes/translations have been incorporated into the text within brackets [ ].

            "text": "**Spoiler Warning:** The events described in this article take place over the next few weeks of the Diary. Some of these events will be commented on by Sam, although his Diary entries regarding the subject matter are not included in this article. The incidents discussed are specific to the Queen, King and Court and include letters and observations by Ambassadors who experienced these events first hand. Commentary by historians and biographers of Charles and Catherine is also presented. Daily diary readers, who may choose to proceed, may find an interest in noting the accuracy/inaccuracy of Sam's \"intelligence\" through his upcoming Diary entries in comparison to the information from the Ambassadors set forth herein.\n\nSam's diary entry referenced above seems to refer simply to [Queen Catherine](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/), and yet given the complexities in the Court of [Charles II](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/), Sam's one line evokes the myriad of background manoeuvrings, emotions and politics surrounding the Queen, her illness and the fallout that her potential death could have on England at this time. The intention of this article is to share a perspective on the \"social\" politics of the time, beginning by turning our attention to the ladies of Charles II. \n\nThe political affairs (as reported by Sam over the past few months) concerning [Lord Bristol](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/) had taken their turn against him. Political courtiers were distancing themselves from him. [Lady Castlemaine](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/) had been a big supporter of Bristol's but, \n\n> as Bristol sank from view, so Castlemaine's absolute dominance of the King's sexual affections vanished. In mid-1663 Charles conceived a passion for a virgin of about sixteen years, [Frances Stuart](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/), daughter of a Scottish Catholic royalist. Sent to court in 1662 her remarkable elfin beauty soon created comment, and by early 1663 Barbara [Castlemaine] had befriended her in a desperate effort to reinforce the King's interest in her own company. This failed, for in June Charles's lust for Frances was patent and he was quarreling with Castlemaine. Throughout the summer and autumn Bennet and other courtiers attempted to use the new favourite to strengthen their own influence with him. What halted this course of events was the personality of Frances herself. The evidence remains unclear as to whether she was at this period a clever and virtuous woman or a feather-headed innocent, but the upshot was clear; she refused absolutely to surrender herself to the King or to take political affairs seriously.\n\n(Hutton, p. 204).  In addition, in September, Castlemaine had given birth to a son Henry, and, once again, there was some initial flack on Charles' behalf as to whether he would claim this child as his own. Castlemaine had been known to be less than faithful to him.  Frances' star was rising, but as long as she remained a virgin, Charles still had a need to keep Castlemaine in the wings. \n \nMeanwhile, Queen Catherine, and a good portion of Charles' court, had spent the months of August through October visiting the waters at [Tunbridge Wells](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6540/) and then those at [Bath](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6651/) all in an attempt for the Queen to partake of these healing waters and hopefully become pregnant. Lady Castelmaine did not attend the Queen on these trips due to her pregnancy, but Frances Stuart was among the Queen's entourage.  It is not clear if Catherine returned from this journey carrying a child or not, as historians have different views on this, with Sousa and Mackay stating that she was pregnant, miscarried and became ill, perhaps as the result of the loss of the child. Other historians/biographers state that she had returned from the waters without conceiving and then succumbed to some sort of \"spotted fever\" (a generic term for a host of possible illnesses).  What is clear is that her illness itself exposed the rather complex and conflicted side of her husband and sent ripples through the courtiers and politicians in their jockeying for status and power. \n\nHer illness seemed to strike quickly and her health began to deteriorate rapidly.  As Sousa translates from Virginia Rau's Portuguese account (Sousa, p. 68-69):\n\n> The queen asked to be given over to the cares of her Portuguese attendants, and that her beautiful hair be shaven so that they could dress her in a cap of precious relics. The Portuguese family wept noisily as they prepared the queen for death. They believed that a princess of her lineages had to make a will, take leave of her servants one by one, make a professions of faith out loud, and be administered the last rites, the most important Communion of her religion. These rituals were so drawn out that the queen was unable to sleep, and they kept her in a state of dangerous agitation.\n\nIn addition to the ritual of the night-cap, which was supposed to bear powers of miraculous healing, was the seemingly odd ritual of slaughtering pigeons and placing their reeking carcasses at her feet. \n\n> There are curious folk-tales about the connection of the pigeon with death, based on the old belief that the dove was a messenger from the spirit world. Thus when a ship foundered in the olden times the spectators on shore used to see the souls of the newly drowned ascending to heaven in the shape of doves. An associated belief was that dying people cannot take leave of life if they are lying on a bed of pigeons' feathers.\n\n(Bury article, online). Finally, amongst the chanting of Latin prayers and the entourage of crying Portuguese attendants, Charles reached his limit of patience. He cleaned the room of all but a limited number of Catherine's women. From this point on he would take charge of her care. \n\nCatherine, grateful for her husband's attention and believing that she was dying, kept her regard for her husband in the forefront of her thoughts as she prepared to depart this world. She told him that \"the concern he shewed for her death was enough to make her quit life with regret; but that not possessing charms sufficient to merit his tenderness, she had at least the consolation in dying to give place to a consort, who might be more worthy of it, and to whom heaven, perhaps, might grant a blessing [an heir] that had been refused to her.\" (Grammont, chapter 7 online). Charles was deeply touched by her honest concern of placing his needs above her own, and was sincerely grief-stricken, as attested by the following observers. \n\n[Lord Arlington](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/) [Bennet] in a letter to the Duke of Ormond, dated the 17th of October, says, \"the condition of the queen is much worse, and the physicians give us but little hopes of her recovery: by the next you will hear she is either in a fair way to it, or dead: to-morrow is a very critical day with her: God's will be done. The king coming to see her this morning, she told him she willingly left all the world but him; which hath very much afflicted his majesty, and all the court with him.\" (Brown, p. 306.).\n\nThe fever spiked and Catherine was in a critical state. When the initial fever broke, there was a slight sigh of relief but additional factors kept her struggling for her life for several weeks. Charles remained uncharacteristically devoted to her at this time. Sousa explains the Portuguese perspective, that \"The Marquis de Sande, who also spent many hours sitting up with the queen, witnessed the affection which Charles felt for Catherine. [In a letter to Catherine's mother, Donna Luisa,] Francisco de Melo wrote about Charles' grief and mentioned that he had often taken Charles from Catherine's arms weeping copiously from seeing his wife so near death.\" (Sousa, p. 71).  \n\nThe French Ambassador, [Cominges](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6192/) in his correspondence to Louis XIV, provided  details, along with gossip. \n\n> I am just come from Whitehall, where I have left the Queen in such state that, according to physicians, little room is left for hope. She has received the extreme unction this morning... She has moreover made her last recommendations to the King, asking him to have her body sent back to Portugal, and not to desert the cause of the little kingdom then hard pressed by Spain... The Portuguese are excessively unpopular here, and their ambassador himself is not secure from aspersions. They are accused, and he especially, of having contributed by their bad management to the death of the Queen. ... Tis true that, to please her, she was left two or three days in their hands; but the King, having perceived that they increased her illness and went even the length of having her take a number of remedies of their country, has put a stop to those things.\n\n(Jusserand p. 88-89). The Ambassador would go on to provide the \"juicy\" gossip that although Charles spent his days attending to his wife; he spent his evenings with Lady Castlemaine in order to pursue Frances Stuart.\n\n> Through she has some little respite from time to time, I despair of her recovery... The King seems to me deeply affected. Well! He supped none the less yesterday with Madame de Castlemaine and had his usual talk with Mlle. Stewart, of whom he is excessively fond. There is already a talk of his marrying again, and everybody gives him a new wife according to his own inclination; and there are some who do not look beyond England to find one for him.\n\n(Jusserand, p 88-89). This allusion was to Frances Stuart. \n\nAlong with the push of Frances into the forefront of the courtiers' minds as a replacement for Catherine came the political moves working against Lady Castelmaine.   Andrews explains that with the shift of Charles' affections towards Frances Stuart (combined with Bristol's fall from grace, mentioned above), that Castlemaine's \"former cabal remained aloof, and Bennet had joined the 'committee' organized by the [Duke of Buckingham](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2258/) to promote the King's marriage to Frances Stuart in the case of the Queen's death -- a proposal which Buckingham kept in his mind even when the Queen revived.\" (Andrews, p. 106). Wilson rounds out the political view by checking in on the 'Somerset Group' ([Henrietta Marie](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/), and Frances' mother were among this crowd), when he explains that \n\n> the Somerset House group had made their choice and matters seemed to be falling out better than they could have hoped. Little Frances had no political standing but, by the same token, she would bring with her no political baggage. Freed from a Portuguese alliance which had become an embarrassment, Charles would have no wish to tie himself in fresh diplomatic coils. He would be free to follow his own desires - and there was no doubt where they led.\n\n(Wilson, p. 197).\n\n> There was little doubt in anyone's mind that the King would have married her [Frances], had the Queen died. Such a marriage would have been unusual; it would of course have caused a stir; but no doubt the importance of the distant connection of the Blantyre Stuarts with the Royal House would have been insisted upon and exaggerated, and, to allay popular scruples as to the suitability of the match, evidence of royal descent would have been ingeniously bolstered up by judicious inventions. At any rate, the kinship, distant as it was, had always been admitted and stressed, and, since the first Lord Blantyre had been brought up with James I, the association of the two families had been drawn even closer.\n\n(Hartmann, pp. 64-65). The plans and arguments to establish Frances were well underway. \n\nThe more politically seasoned French Ambassador, de Lionne \"told Louis that the meanest of the courtiers was busy in selecting a new wife for Charles, and that the daughter of the Prince de Ligne, to whom Charles had been reported to be attached during his exile, was confidently spoken of. This would be an alliance greatly backed by Spain, who had had enough of England as Portugal's ally\". (Davidson, p. 203). Where Charles was so cash strapped choosing between love, money and political alliances only added to the dimensions the courtiers had to consider. \n\nWith all of the political plans and machinations taking place, there was one thing that these courtiers hadn't counted on, and that was that the inner emotions and despair revealed by Queen Catherine would leave an everlasting impression on her husband and throw and emotional wrench into all of the political works. Over the next few weeks Catherine was so weak that her death seemed imminent. She wavered in and out of a cohesive state. During her more lucid moments she declared her affection for her husband and regard for his welfare, but during her delirious moments she revealed her private inner turmoil. \n\n> Her mind during her illness was constantly occupied with her desire for a child; in her delirium she imagined that she had at least given birth to an heir. Its ugliness seemed to distress her, so the King, to humour her, assured her that it was a very pretty boy. \"Nay,\" said the Queen, \"if it be like you, it is a fine boy indeed and I would be very pleased with it.\" During the succeeding days she imagined that she had given birth to two more children, and was delighted that the girl was so much like the King. Charles was most distressed at his Queen's illness, and his tenderness for her was increased by the knowledge of her love for him which she betrayed in her delusions. He sat constantly by her bed-side, and tearfully besought her to live for his sake.\n\n(Hartmann, p. 63-65).   \n\nGrammont, quite mean-spirited in this case and bearing a different view than actual observers, stated sarcastically,\n\n> at these words, she bathed his hands with some tears, which he thought would be her last: he mingled his own with hers; and without supposing she would take him at his word, he conjured her to live for his sake. She had never yet disobeyed him; and, however dangerous sudden impulses may be, when one is between life and death, this transport of joy, which might have proved fatal to her, saved her life, and the king's wonderful tenderness had an effect, for which every person did not thank heaven in the same manner.\n\n(Chapter 7, online). \n\nAccording to court etiquette, Catherine was still expected to accept diplomatic visitors during her illness. Louis sent a Monsieur de Cateu with a personal message of condolences. Poor Catherine was partially deaf due to the fever, so Charles escorted the diplomat to see her. Charles had to yell the message to her as in her current state she could barely understand it. In a message to King Louis de Lionne claims, \n\n> She was, it was reported, much gratified by the attention of Louis and his Queen, and said so herself in quite clear words. De Lionne was courtier enough to inform his master that no doubt His Majesty's kindness in sending a special message had much to do with Catherine's recovery. Lord Aubigny, her almoner, told her she must impute her recovery to the cap of relics, and the extreme unction. Catherine, in spite of being so profound a devotee, replied to him that it was not so, but that it must rather be laid to the prayers of her husband.\n\n(Davidson, p 203). Depending on what country one came from (and/or their level of savvy diplomatic experience) it seems that the get well wishes of ones respective king were the cause of her recovery.  The Portuguese saw it differently. In his letter to Catherine's mother, Francisco de Melo told her that God had remembered her devotion, the effect of her great and public faith and that her recovery was a miracle. He also assured Donna Luisa that along with the visits from the [Duke of York](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/), the Queen Mother and [Prince Rupert](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/) that all were there to assist Catherine. (Letter translation/summary provided by this site's Pedro.)\n\nSlowly, the Queen started to mend, but not without the loss of her hearing which remained for quite some time. For a few weeks she was unable to stand. During this time, de Lionne informed Louis that he \"thought her brain affected hopelessly, and says that though she was out of danger she still wandered.\" (Davidson, p. 203).  As she began to heal and her lucidity returned, the plans of the cabals and potential future queen faded. \n\n> Whatever dreams Frances may have had were shattered by the Queen's restoration of health; for she could never hope to be Queen while Catherine lived. Charles was no Henry VIII; in his strange perverse way he was really fond of his Queen, and always rejected with contumely any suggestion of divorcing her. But if he abandoned all idea of marrying Frances, his passion for her was undiminished, and he became all the more determined to make her his mistress.\n\n(Hartmann, p. 66). In addition to all of the disappointments that Frances and the cabals de jour may have felt a sarcastic Cominges summed up the feelings regarding Catherine's turning the corner on her health by explaining to Louis that there \"'were great rejoicing, none being more sincere', the ambassador wickedly observes, 'than the Duke of York's and his wife's.'\" (Jusserand, p. 89).  For now, it was thought that all that seemingly stood between James and the throne was a barren Queen, a popular thought perhaps, for the Duke of York, but not for those opposed to him. \n\nNorrington believes that \"it is an endearing side to Charles's character that although he was so deeply in love with Frances Stuart, when his wife became so ill his devotion to her was outstanding, even if it robbed him of the chance not only to marry a woman he loved, but also, probably, to have some legitimate children.\" (Norrington, p. 70). Others note this seeming conflict as a result of the complexity of Charles' character and his inability to see any lady suffer.\n\n> In proportion as the Queen regained her health and spirits, the King's revived affection for her diminished, and by the beginning of the New Year, when she was quite well again, he had already begun to relax those devoted attentions, which had contributed so much to her recovery. During the critical days of her illness his affection had been genuine enough; for, like most cynics, Charles was thoroughly sentimental, and the spectacle of the suffering of the women, who, he knew, adored him had touched him so profoundly that he had found his placid half-contemptuous affection transformed for the time being into something very nearly approaching real love. There had been no insincerity in his tears over her or his passionate prayers to her to live for his sake; his emotion had indeed been so intense as to turn his hair grey. But now that there was no longer any cause for anxiety he experiences revulsion of feeling. The grey hair was hidden under a curling jet-black periwig of the latest fashion, and thus rejuvenated the King thrust his wife once again into the background of his life, and renewed his pursuit of Frances Stuart.\n\n(Hartmann, p. 67-68). \n\nAs it became clear that Catherine was now safe, Charles himself summed up the Queen's recovery in the following letter to his sister Minette. (Norrington, p. 70).\n\n> Charles to Minette 2 November 1663 (excerpt)\n\n> My wife is now out of danger, though very weake, and it was a very strange feaver. For she talked idely fouer or five dayes after the feaver had left her, but now that is likewise past, and desires me to make her compliments to you and Monsieur, which she will do her selfe, as soone as she getts strength, and so my dearest sister, I will trouble you no more at this time, but beg of you to love him who is intierely yours. C.R.\n\nAs the year will come to a close Sam will no doubt report on the ins and outs of the Queen's health and the gossip surrounding Charles' ladies. Things will return to the \"norm\" during this time with Charles dividing \n\n> between three women at the same time the love that an ordinary man would devote to one at different stages of his passion. His love for Frances was romantic, it was love at its birth, an irresistible attraction towards youth and beauty and gaiety, while with the Queen it was love growing old, tenderness free from passion, a placid affection which was a haven for all his better instincts. But both romance and tenderness were lacking in his feelings for Lady Castlemaine; she appealed now only to that which was basest in him; the physical element, naked and undisguised, was all that survived of his former passion for her, save for a kindliness which natures like his often retain for those whom they have once loved, and which is more an effect of memory than a reflection of present feelings.\n\n(Hartmann p 67-68).\n\nHutton does point out that this illness did bring a slight improvement between the relationship between the King and Queen, when he tells us that the \"reconciliation survived her recovery, and henceforth the royal affections were divided between the three women, two of whom declined to meddle in public affairs. The area available to political intrigue in court life was thus further circumscribed.\" (Hutton, p. 204)\n\nBut in a touching and poignant poem, perhaps we'll give the kind poet Waller the last word.

Some of these events will be commented on by Sam, although his Diary entries regarding the subject matter are not included in this article. The incidents discussed are specific to the Queen, King and Court and include letters and observations by Ambassadors who experienced these events first hand. Commentary by historians and biographers of Charles and Catherine is also presented. Daily diary readers, who may choose to proceed, may find an interest in noting the accuracy/inaccuracy of Sam's \"intelligence\" through his upcoming Diary entries in comparison to the information from the Ambassadors set forth herein.</p>\n<p>Sam's diary entry referenced above seems to refer simply to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a>, and yet given the complexities in the Court of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">Charles II</a>, Sam's one line evokes the myriad of background manoeuvrings, emotions and politics surrounding the Queen, her illness and the fallout that her potential death could have on England at this time. The intention of this article is to share a perspective on the \"social\" politics of the time, beginning by turning our attention to the ladies of Charles II. </p>\n<p>The political affairs (as reported by Sam over the past few months) concerning <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/\">Lord Bristol</a> had taken their turn against him. Political courtiers were distancing themselves from him. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/\">Lady Castlemaine</a> had been a big supporter of Bristol's but, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>as Bristol sank from view, so Castlemaine's absolute dominance of the King's sexual affections vanished. In mid-1663 Charles conceived a passion for a virgin of about sixteen years, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/\">Frances Stuart</a>, daughter of a Scottish Catholic royalist. Sent to court in 1662 her remarkable elfin beauty soon created comment, and by early 1663 Barbara [Castlemaine] had befriended her in a desperate effort to reinforce the King's interest in her own company. This failed, for in June Charles's lust for Frances was patent and he was quarreling with Castlemaine. Throughout the summer and autumn Bennet and other courtiers attempted to use the new favourite to strengthen their own influence with him. What halted this course of events was the personality of Frances herself. The evidence remains unclear as to whether she was at this period a clever and virtuous woman or a feather-headed innocent, but the upshot was clear; she refused absolutely to surrender herself to the King or to take political affairs seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Hutton, p. 204).  In addition, in September, Castlemaine had given birth to a son Henry, and, once again, there was some initial flack on Charles' behalf as to whether he would claim this child as his own. Castlemaine had been known to be less than faithful to him.  Frances' star was rising, but as long as she remained a virgin, Charles still had a need to keep Castlemaine in the wings. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Queen Catherine, and a good portion of Charles' court, had spent the months of August through October visiting the waters at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6540/\">Tunbridge Wells</a> and then those at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6651/\">Bath</a> all in an attempt for the Queen to partake of these healing waters and hopefully become pregnant. Lady Castelmaine did not attend the Queen on these trips due to her pregnancy, but Frances Stuart was among the Queen's entourage.  It is not clear if Catherine returned from this journey carrying a child or not, as historians have different views on this, with Sousa and Mackay stating that she was pregnant, miscarried and became ill, perhaps as the result of the loss of the child. Other historians/biographers state that she had returned from the waters without conceiving and then succumbed to some sort of \"spotted fever\" (a generic term for a host of possible illnesses).  What is clear is that her illness itself exposed the rather complex and conflicted side of her husband and sent ripples through the courtiers and politicians in their jockeying for status and power. </p>\n<p>Her illness seemed to strike quickly and her health began to deteriorate rapidly.  As Sousa translates from Virginia Rau's Portuguese account (Sousa, p. 68-69):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The queen asked to be given over to the cares of her Portuguese attendants, and that her beautiful hair be shaven so that they could dress her in a cap of precious relics. The Portuguese family wept noisily as they prepared the queen for death. They believed that a princess of her lineages had to make a will, take leave of her servants one by one, make a professions of faith out loud, and be administered the last rites, the most important Communion of her religion. These rituals were so drawn out that the queen was unable to sleep, and they kept her in a state of dangerous agitation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the ritual of the night-cap, which was supposed to bear powers of miraculous healing, was the seemingly odd ritual of slaughtering pigeons and placing their reeking carcasses at her feet. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are curious folk-tales about the connection of the pigeon with death, based on the old belief that the dove was a messenger from the spirit world. Thus when a ship foundered in the olden times the spectators on shore used to see the souls of the newly drowned ascending to heaven in the shape of doves. An associated belief was that dying people cannot take leave of life if they are lying on a bed of pigeons' feathers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Bury article, online). Finally, amongst the chanting of Latin prayers and the entourage of crying Portuguese attendants, Charles reached his limit of patience. He cleaned the room of all but a limited number of Catherine's women. From this point on he would take charge of her care. </p>\n<p>Catherine, grateful for her husband's attention and believing that she was dying, kept her regard for her husband in the forefront of her thoughts as she prepared to depart this world. She told him that \"the concern he shewed for her death was enough to make her quit life with regret; but that not possessing charms sufficient to merit his tenderness, she had at least the consolation in dying to give place to a consort, who might be more worthy of it, and to whom heaven, perhaps, might grant a blessing [an heir] that had been refused to her.\" (Grammont, chapter 7 online). Charles was deeply touched by her honest concern of placing his needs above her own, and was sincerely grief-stricken, as attested by the following observers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/\">Lord Arlington</a> [Bennet] in a letter to the Duke of Ormond, dated the 17th of October, says, \"the condition of the queen is much worse, and the physicians give us but little hopes of her recovery: by the next you will hear she is either in a fair way to it, or dead: to-morrow is a very critical day with her: God's will be done. The king coming to see her this morning, she told him she willingly left all the world but him; which hath very much afflicted his majesty, and all the court with him.\" (Brown, p. 306.).</p>\n<p>The fever spiked and Catherine was in a critical state. When the initial fever broke, there was a slight sigh of relief but additional factors kept her struggling for her life for several weeks. Charles remained uncharacteristically devoted to her at this time. Sousa explains the Portuguese perspective, that \"The Marquis de Sande, who also spent many hours sitting up with the queen, witnessed the affection which Charles felt for Catherine. [In a letter to Catherine's mother, Donna Luisa,] Francisco de Melo wrote about Charles' grief and mentioned that he had often taken Charles from Catherine's arms weeping copiously from seeing his wife so near death.\" (Sousa, p. 71).  </p>\n<p>The French Ambassador, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6192/\">Cominges</a> in his correspondence to Louis XIV, provided  details, along with gossip. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am just come from Whitehall, where I have left the Queen in such state that, according to physicians, little room is left for hope. She has received the extreme unction this morning... She has moreover made her last recommendations to the King, asking him to have her body sent back to Portugal, and not to desert the cause of the little kingdom then hard pressed by Spain... The Portuguese are excessively unpopular here, and their ambassador himself is not secure from aspersions. They are accused, and he especially, of having contributed by their bad management to the death of the Queen. ... Tis true that, to please her, she was left two or three days in their hands; but the King, having perceived that they increased her illness and went even the length of having her take a number of remedies of their country, has put a stop to those things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Jusserand p. 88-89). The Ambassador would go on to provide the \"juicy\" gossip that although Charles spent his days attending to his wife; he spent his evenings with Lady Castlemaine in order to pursue Frances Stuart.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Through she has some little respite from time to time, I despair of her recovery... The King seems to me deeply affected. Well! He supped none the less yesterday with Madame de Castlemaine and had his usual talk with Mlle. Stewart, of whom he is excessively fond. There is already a talk of his marrying again, and everybody gives him a new wife according to his own inclination; and there are some who do not look beyond England to find one for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Jusserand, p 88-89). This allusion was to Frances Stuart. </p>\n<p>Along with the push of Frances into the forefront of the courtiers' minds as a replacement for Catherine came the political moves working against Lady Castelmaine.   Andrews explains that with the shift of Charles' affections towards Frances Stuart (combined with Bristol's fall from grace, mentioned above), that Castlemaine's \"former cabal remained aloof, and Bennet had joined the 'committee' organized by the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2258/\">Duke of Buckingham</a> to promote the King's marriage to Frances Stuart in the case of the Queen's death -- a proposal which Buckingham kept in his mind even when the Queen revived.\" (Andrews, p. 106). Wilson rounds out the political view by checking in on the 'Somerset Group' (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Henrietta Marie</a>, and Frances' mother were among this crowd), when he explains that </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Somerset House group had made their choice and matters seemed to be falling out better than they could have hoped. Little Frances had no political standing but, by the same token, she would bring with her no political baggage. Freed from a Portuguese alliance which had become an embarrassment, Charles would have no wish to tie himself in fresh diplomatic coils. He would be free to follow his own desires - and there was no doubt where they led.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Wilson, p. 197).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was little doubt in anyone's mind that the King would have married her [Frances], had the Queen died. Such a marriage would have been unusual; it would of course have caused a stir; but no doubt the importance of the distant connection of the Blantyre Stuarts with the Royal House would have been insisted upon and exaggerated, and, to allay popular scruples as to the suitability of the match, evidence of royal descent would have been ingeniously bolstered up by judicious inventions. At any rate, the kinship, distant as it was, had always been admitted and stressed, and, since the first Lord Blantyre had been brought up with James I, the association of the two families had been drawn even closer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Hartmann, pp. 64-65). The plans and arguments to establish Frances were well underway. </p>\n<p>The more politically seasoned French Ambassador, de Lionne \"told Louis that the meanest of the courtiers was busy in selecting a new wife for Charles, and that the daughter of the Prince de Ligne, to whom Charles had been reported to be attached during his exile, was confidently spoken of. This would be an alliance greatly backed by Spain, who had had enough of England as Portugal's ally\". (Davidson, p. 203). Where Charles was so cash strapped choosing between love, money and political alliances only added to the dimensions the courtiers had to consider. </p>\n<p>With all of the political plans and machinations taking place, there was one thing that these courtiers hadn't counted on, and that was that the inner emotions and despair revealed by Queen Catherine would leave an everlasting impression on her husband and throw and emotional wrench into all of the political works. Over the next few weeks Catherine was so weak that her death seemed imminent. She wavered in and out of a cohesive state. During her more lucid moments she declared her affection for her husband and regard for his welfare, but during her delirious moments she revealed her private inner turmoil. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Her mind during her illness was constantly occupied with her desire for a child; in her delirium she imagined that she had at least given birth to an heir. Its ugliness seemed to distress her, so the King, to humour her, assured her that it was a very pretty boy. \"Nay,\" said the Queen, \"if it be like you, it is a fine boy indeed and I would be very pleased with it.\" During the succeeding days she imagined that she had given birth to two more children, and was delighted that the girl was so much like the King. Charles was most distressed at his Queen's illness, and his tenderness for her was increased by the knowledge of her love for him which she betrayed in her delusions. He sat constantly by her bed-side, and tearfully besought her to live for his sake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Hartmann, p. 63-65).   </p>\n<p>Grammont, quite mean-spirited in this case and bearing a different view than actual observers, stated sarcastically,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>at these words, she bathed his hands with some tears, which he thought would be her last: he mingled his own with hers; and without supposing she would take him at his word, he conjured her to live for his sake. She had never yet disobeyed him; and, however dangerous sudden impulses may be, when one is between life and death, this transport of joy, which might have proved fatal to her, saved her life, and the king's wonderful tenderness had an effect, for which every person did not thank heaven in the same manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Chapter 7, online). </p>\n<p>According to court etiquette, Catherine was still expected to accept diplomatic visitors during her illness. Louis sent a Monsieur de Cateu with a personal message of condolences. Poor Catherine was partially deaf due to the fever, so Charles escorted the diplomat to see her. Charles had to yell the message to her as in her current state she could barely understand it. In a message to King Louis de Lionne claims, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She was, it was reported, much gratified by the attention of Louis and his Queen, and said so herself in quite clear words. De Lionne was courtier enough to inform his master that no doubt His Majesty's kindness in sending a special message had much to do with Catherine's recovery. Lord Aubigny, her almoner, told her she must impute her recovery to the cap of relics, and the extreme unction. Catherine, in spite of being so profound a devotee, replied to him that it was not so, but that it must rather be laid to the prayers of her husband.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Davidson, p 203). Depending on what country one came from (and/or their level of savvy diplomatic experience) it seems that the get well wishes of ones respective king were the cause of her recovery.  The Portuguese saw it differently. In his letter to Catherine's mother, Francisco de Melo told her that God had remembered her devotion, the effect of her great and public faith and that her recovery was a miracle. He also assured Donna Luisa that along with the visits from the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Duke of York</a>, the Queen Mother and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/\">Prince Rupert</a> that all were there to assist Catherine. (Letter translation/summary provided by this site's Pedro.)</p>\n<p>Slowly, the Queen started to mend, but not without the loss of her hearing which remained for quite some time. For a few weeks she was unable to stand. During this time, de Lionne informed Louis that he \"thought her brain affected hopelessly, and says that though she was out of danger she still wandered.\" (Davidson, p. 203).  As she began to heal and her lucidity returned, the plans of the cabals and potential future queen faded. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever dreams Frances may have had were shattered by the Queen's restoration of health; for she could never hope to be Queen while Catherine lived. Charles was no Henry VIII; in his strange perverse way he was really fond of his Queen, and always rejected with contumely any suggestion of divorcing her. But if he abandoned all idea of marrying Frances, his passion for her was undiminished, and he became all the more determined to make her his mistress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Hartmann, p. 66). In addition to all of the disappointments that Frances and the cabals de jour may have felt a sarcastic Cominges summed up the feelings regarding Catherine's turning the corner on her health by explaining to Louis that there \"'were great rejoicing, none being more sincere', the ambassador wickedly observes, 'than the Duke of York's and his wife's.'\" (Jusserand, p. 89).  For now, it was thought that all that seemingly stood between James and the throne was a barren Queen, a popular thought perhaps, for the Duke of York, but not for those opposed to him. </p>\n<p>Norrington believes that \"it is an endearing side to Charles's character that although he was so deeply in love with Frances Stuart, when his wife became so ill his devotion to her was outstanding, even if it robbed him of the chance not only to marry a woman he loved, but also, probably, to have some legitimate children.\" (Norrington, p. 70).

            "text": "<h3>I. \tThe Search for Her Voice</h3>\n\n<p>Scholars, historians, writers and curious others have searched for the \"voice\" of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/\">Elizabeth Pepys</a>, only to succumb to the sad realisation that none of her letters or writings exist, or, if in existence, as those die hard optimists may hope, they have yet to be found. Perhaps, like the recently discovered manuscripts of Robert Hooke, some disheveled family will finally clean out an attic, old trunk or cabinet and discover the secrets of her perspective.  In the meantime, Pepysians in search of her secrets have been left to gather their \"evidence\" from Sam's Diary and piece together their interpretations along with the rest of us.</p>\n\n<p>Sam provides an overwhelming window into his life through his collective writings, especially in  his Diary, letters and assorted correspondence.  He is the subject of countless books, articles, essays and fan clubs. The comparison of the vast amount of information presented about him verses the scant whispers of information presented about Elizabeth form a sharp contrast. The search for her voice is quite frankly a dead ended lesson in frustration. Even her \"biographers\" can only offer us at best additional areas of scholarly debate, minimal background information into her family, but never anything more than a hint into her life before Sam.  Those readers hoping to find as a \"destination\" the voice of Elizabeth will no doubt be disappointed, as quite honestly was I, with the limitations of this article. Those who may enjoy the journey as opposed to the destination may walk away with a few thoughts to ponder about this intriguing lady and her family.</p>\n\n<p>Writers see things through their own eyes and not without their own biases. The kindly philosophical Percival Hunt, sees Sam expecting Elizabeth \"to be his wife, and a housekeeper, and a companion, and wise and encouraging. Besides, she was to retire into a cloud when he had work to do, and was to know without telling when to leave him alone. She was, that is, to be all things to one man\" (Hunt, p.167). Richard Ollard's interpretation is that Elizabeth \"consistently shows in the Diary an attractive and unselfish readiness to enter into her husband's interests and to offer him her untutored natural abilities and tastes to shape and direct.\" (Ollard, p.123).... She \"had no power, no resources no friends. Her raison d'etre was to please him. She could make herself disagreeable, but that was all. He held all the cards; money, freedom, social opportunity, and played them for himself. Increasingly this meant that the world he lived in grew apart from hers.\" (Ollard, p.127)\". </p>\n\n<p>A less sympathetic view of Elizabeth includes Bryant description of a young Elizabeth as a totally unsuitable partner for Sam, calling her \"a pale little chit of a foreign beauty who could bring him nothing but trouble,\" (Bryant, p.26) and flatly stating that \"the plain fact remained that she was somewhat of a fool.\" (Bryant, p.28). Robert Lewis Stevenson, who abounds with admiration for Sam reduces Elizabeth simply to \"vulgar\". </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, these \"learned interpretations\" all draw their views from the same place and space that we gather to read each day, Sam's Diary. In order to broaden our view of Elizabeth, who has no voice of her own, perhaps we can gain a better understanding of her through understanding her family life prior to Sam. For this, we need to turn towards the one other person who knew her dearly, has written about her and offered hints as to her life before the Diary. That would be her brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/\">Balty</a>. </p>\n\n\n<h3>II.\t A Letter from Balty</h3>\n\n<p>One of the more famous family letters that is referenced in abundance by Pepysians is a letter that Balty wrote to Sam long after the Diary had come to a close. The background to this letter will help us to weave through its deliberately misleading intent and yet, perhaps reveal the upheaval and instability that Elizabeth knew and called home. </p>\n\n<p>In order to get to her past, we need to jump ahead into the future. Throughout <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">Charles II's</a> reign,  a political plot worked against <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">James</a>, the Duke of York and a number of other Papists in high places (including <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a>). The plot(s) were intended to discredit Catholics who were close to the King, with the hope to gain control of the succession of the Crown. In 1678, these clandestine plans would prove \"personal\" (Heath, p.xiii) and involve Sam, with the hopes to reflect poorly upon his patron, James, the Duke of York. This activity was part of the overall Popish Plots. During this time, the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a well know Protestant magistrate, opened a huge opportunity for the conspirators to blame the Papists for his death.  Helen Heath explains that the original plan may have been to implicate Pepys in the murder of Godfrey. Luckily, Sam was away at the time of the murder so the conspirators went after his clerk, Samuel Atkins. The evidence proved so false that the boy was released, but as a follow up a Colonel John Scott invented evidence against Sam to lead to his arrest on the charges of piracy, popery and treachery. Among the many charges was the one leading to Balty's letter, which stated that Sam had \"secretly turned to the Catholic Church, had hidden crucifixes in his home, [and] had consorted with Catholics\" (Heath, p.xiv). </p>\n\n<p>Sam, now in prison, had a desperate need to clear his name, which involved the need for \"spy\" work be done in France in order to discredit and prove his accuser a liar. To his credit, and, most likely to the amazement of many Diary readers, Balty rose magnificently to the occasion and herein proved his greatest service to Sam. In spite of all his flaws and failures he went to France to pursue \" a sort of double life between the wealthy merchants of Pepys acquaintance, on the one hand, and the rogues and vagabonds who consort with the  nefarious Colonel Scott on the other\" (Heath, p.xxv). </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Balty penned the following letter to Sam, with the intent of \"proving\" that the charge of Popery in his home was false and misleading. Although the readers of the Diary will all know that Elizabeth had a leaning towards Catholicism, the letter provides us with the only other known \"glimpse\" into the family life of the St. Michel's, and therefore holds some of the only other \"hints\" at Elizabeth's life prior to the Diary. This letter is not without controversy, yet it forms the basis that many historians have drawn from to describe her life prior to Sam. Sam's biographers (Chappell, Bryant, Tomilin) and Elizabeth's biographers (Chappell, Delaforce) all reference this  letter, albeit, sometimes drawing conflicting perspectives.  Tomalin does \"warn\" us that Balty \"wrote it down with the specific intention of proving that his sister was a staunch Protestant, whereas it is clear from Pepys's own account that the Catholic faith never lost its hold on her; when, for instance, he bought a mass book for himself in 1660 and sat up late reading it, it gave \"great pleasure to my wife to hear that that she long ago was so well acquainted with\"  (Tomalin, p.55).</p> \n\n<p>In addition to the Catholicism issue, the letter causes debate on other grounds as Elizabeth's birthplace is brought into question. Balty will note in this letter that \"Devonsheire at a Place Caled Bidiford, where, and thereabouts my sister and wee all ware borne\" while Edwin Chappell, a noted 19th century Pepysian scholar,  will point out that \"the inscription on her monument in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/\">St. Olave's Church</a>, Hart Street, E.C., in which is stated that Somerset gave her cradle\" (Chappell, p.33).  Writing for the 1932 Somerset Year-Book, Chapell's article explores the birthplace debate from all angles and finally asks \"may I request that all baptismal registers [in every Somerset parish] for 23rd October, 1640, be inspected, and this interesting point might be definitely settled?\" (Chappell, p.34). It's not clear that this mystery has been conclusively solved to date either. </p>\n\n<p>Another interesting point of debate has to do with the parentage of Elizabeth's mother Dorethea. Marjorie Astin's biography of Elizabeth, which differs on this point from all others (discussed in II and IV), states that Dorethea was the \"daughter of Lavinia and Matthew Penneford of Gort, and widow of Thomas Fleetwood. She was closely connected with the Kingsmills, a family of considerable worth and consequence, who had resided at Basingstoke, Hants, from the twelfth to sixteenth century; they had received a grant from the Royal Mill there, from which they derived their name.\" (Astin, p.10). Perhaps it is best to put these \"details of debate\" into the broader perspective, where through this letter we will see that the results infer that Elizabeth had a \"curious childhood, full of poverty and unrest, for her father was often abroad earning his bread as a soldier.\" (Astin, p.12). </p>\n\n<p>Helen Heath, who edited Pepys' family letters, reminds us in the background information on Balty that \"it is to be noted that life in Balty's eyes is never matter-of-fact. Every wind is a hurricane, every mishap a near-catastrophe, every hardship a hell\" (Heath, p.xxiv). She also sums up this famous letter (Letter #21 of the collection) saying, \"Perhaps the most noteworthy and most informative letter from St. Michel is Letter 21, in which is vividly sketched the family background from which he [Balty] and his sister, Pepys's wife, have emerged. Here is depicted as delightfully erratic a family as anyone could wish to choose a wife from\" (Heath, p.xxiv). We must always remember that no matter how erratic the family and their situation, they were still HER family, and no doubt Elizabeth loved them all and remained devoted to them throughout her life. Tomalin tells us (Tomalin, p.210) that \"The deepest bond in her life may well have been with her brother, Balty; it was reciprocal, and each is shown looking out for each other in the pages of the Diary.\" Balty's letter, from the Heath edition (Heath, p.25-28), includes Sam's notation and is printed in full below. </p>\n\n\n<h3>III. \tBalty's Letter to Sam as presented in <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and his Family Circle</cite> edited by Helen Truesdell Heath</h3>\n\n<p><em>Endorsement of Samuel Pepys</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"Brother Balty's letter to mee giveing an account of the Fortune of his Family, perticulerly done for the cleareing the imputation layd on mee in Parliament of my turning his Sister from a Protestant to a Catholique, S.P.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Deale, the 8th February 1673/4</p>\n\n<p>Honoured Sir</p>\n\n<p>In answer to yours of last night which received this morning at 8 of the Clock: I wonder indeed that you, whoose life and Conversation, hath bine ever knowne to be a Ferme Protestant, shoold now be Caled in question of being a  papist; but Sir Malice and Envey will still oppress the best of Men; wherefore Sir to the hazard of my life i will proove (if Occasion be) with my sworde in my hand (since it hath touched soe neare of the memory of my Dear sister) that your Competitor is a false lier in his throught, as to your haveing Eather an Alter in your House, or that my Dear sister Ever since shee had the Honour to be your wife, or to her Death had the least thoughts of Popery, this I know, by my not only often Conversation with her my selfe, but in my Presence on time, i remember, shee haveing some discourse with my Father, conserning your life and Conversation, as well as Fortunes, this was his speech with her, that amongst the Greatest of Happinesses hee injoyed in his minde, was that shee had by matching with you, not only wedded wisdome, but allsoe one whoe by it, hee hoped in Christ, would quite bloute out, those Foolish, Phopish thoughts, shee might in her more tender yeares have had of Popery, theese (to the Best of my memory) ware his very words; to which her reply was (Kissing his Eyes, which shee loved dearly) dear Father said shee, though in my tender yeares, I was, by my low Fortune in this world deluded by popery by the Fonde-didly thereof; I have now a man to my husbande soe wise, and one so religious in the Protestant religion (Joyned with my riper yeares which gives me more understanding) to Ever suffer my thought to bende that way any more.</p>\n\n<p>But Sir, I have given you two much truble with one thinge; Now to what you desir as to the Knoledge how, and when, the Popish Fancis ware first put in my Poore Dear Sisters head; which (to the best of my memory) in Every Pointe I shall declare to you.

Delaforce draws this information from the <cite>Huguenot Societies of England and France</cite>, <cite>Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland</cite>, <cite>O'Hart's Irish Pedigrees</cite>, <cite>Memoires du Duc de Sully</cite>, <cite>Journal de Jean Herouard Medecin du Roi (Henry IV et Loius XIII)</cite>, <cite>\"Weekly Intelligencer\"</cite> of September 30, 1645 and the <cite>Duke of Portland MSS</cite> vol. 3 p.150. His sources are cited here as the \"classification\" of his book reflects a \"Biography\" according to the labeling in the book itself (British Library Cataloguing in Publishing Data), where the US Library of Congress lists it in it's online database as historical fiction. The British Library (online) further adds to the confusion by listing it as both biography and fiction. The book is presented through the \"voice\" of Elizabeth (and others). One \"stretching of fact\" in this book is that, in order to tell her story, during her married years, she is sometimes given a broader view into Sam's \"private world\" than what she actually had (ie. more extensive  knowledge of Sam's womanizing activities). Delaforce's insights into the life and exploits of the extremely handsome, wild, restless and always extravagant Alexandre le Marchant, Sieur de St. Michel reflect a uniquely spirited and adventurous rollercoaster of a ride, which may help to provide a better understanding of the formative influences that Elizabeth was born into. The condensed summary below draws solely from Delaforce's chapters on Alexandre (except as noted in one quotation from Bryant), Delaforce deserves full credit for bringing forth this wonderful detail. Anyone interested in reading a more delightful version of the life and times of Alexandre may enjoy actually locating the book (details below). </p>\n\n<p>Alexandre was born in 1593, the only son to the High Sheriff of Bague in France, and the member of a rich and well connected family. His birth came at the time that King Henri IV acceded to the French throne. Unknowing to the young Alexandre, not only would he serve this King, but a total of 3 sovereigns. In 1610, at the age of 17 he was appointed \"Gentilhomme Ordinaire\" to King Henri.  </p>\n\n<p>In May of that year Alexandre was appointed to supervise King Henri's escort in an open carriage through Paris from the Tuileries towards the Arsenal. During the journey the King's guards had lagged behind the carriage, leaving an opening for a young Catholic fanatic to jump out of the crowd, onto the carriage step and to plunge his sword into the King's side. The attack took all by surprise. Alexandre and the guards disarmed the young man. Alexandre took the King to the Duke of Sully's home near the Arsenal. King Henri died almost immediately. Francois Ravaillac, the assassin was put to death within days. </p>\n\n<p>\"Alexandre was still a Catholic then, but a few years later he went to soldier in the Protestant Princes' armies in the Palentinate and Bohemia, where he was converted. At the age of 21 he had failed to regain his inheritance from his father and uncle, but was accepted back into Court and became Gentilhomme Ordinaire to the young King Louis Treize\" (p.16). This King had a love of hunting and chasing game.  One day in May 1624 Alexandre and the King were riding in the countryside outside Fontainbleu. While chasing a large hare in close proximity to a river, the King's horse stumbled and threw him into the deep water. Alexandre jumped from his horse and scooped the King up into his arms from the deep flowing river. He carried the King back to the palace on his horse where he was delivered to the King's doctor, Jean Heroard, who pronounced him unharmed. \"Alexandre may have failed to protect the father, but he certainly saved the son\" (p.16). </p>\n\n<p>After his loyal service to the two Kings he was chosen to serve the daughter of King Henri Quart, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Princess Henrietta Marie</a>. Upon her wedding to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/\">Charles I</a> in 1625 Alexandre transferred to serve her Court. After her marriage her initial French retinue of about 70 people (mostly housed at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/243/\">Somerset House</a>) swelled to over 400 people, including Alexandre. He served as Gentleman Carver to the Queen and Courier. During this time court scandals abounded (none credited to Alexandre) and Charles I, through the Queen's Lord Chamberlain, sent several hundred of these French families back to France. Although Alexandre was among those sent back, he still maintained his role and provided service to the Queen. This tumultuous year included the start of the siege of the Huguenots at La Rochelle and the English assistance there under the first Duke of Buckingham. </p>\n\n<p>In 1628, the Queen entrusted Alexandre to be the carrier of some valuable gifts from her two sisters (the Princess of Piedmont and Christine, now the wife of the Duke of Savoy). Henrietta had received gifts valued at 200,000 crown, including an Italian chest, crystal glasses, vases, silver and gold cloths. Alexandre was to gather these lavish items and transport them from France to England, which he did successfully. Given the thieves on land and sea, this was no small feat. In a letter to the Duke of Savoy, dated 9 April Henrietta thanked him for the \"'temoignages d'amitie... qu'il lui a envoye... par le Sieur de Saint-Michel.' He carried out many such missions for the Queen both in England and France\" (p.17).</p>\n\n<p>The Queen was a devout and unbending Catholic. Alexandre had been born and raised a Catholic and was wise enough not to flaunt his conversion. Apparently the entourage of priests surrounding the Queen was not so complaisant as to look the other way and over time a physical confrontation of sorts took place between Alexandre and one of the monks. His position of Gentleman Carver was taken from him. He was given the role of Captain of the Queen's Horse and his career took a shift towards the army. </p>\n\n<p>Around 1632 Alexandre was serving in the army in Ireland where he met his soon to be wife (Elizabeth's mother) <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/\">Dorothea</a>. She was born in 1605 and was the youngest child of Sir Francis Kingsmill, who had been knighted in Dublin in 1603 [note that this point regarding Dorethea's  parentage differs from Astin's  set forth above, but Delaforce presents the most commonly expressed heritage, which is consistent with Balty's letter]. Dorothea had initially married Thomas Fleetwood in 1620. He had died in 1632 leaving her a widow with two children [of note, no reference is made again to these children, so it is not known if they were left behind in the care of  the late father's, or Dorothea's  family or if they died in their youth]. Dorothea (now 30) was charmed by Alexandre (now 42) and the two were married, much to the strong objections of her family.  The marriage left her in the sad position of being cut out of all of the family wills and put her welfare solely into the care of her husband (and over time, as we will painfully see to the generosity of her one day son-in-law Sam). </p>\n\n<p>The married couple decided to visit Alexandre's uncle, a wealthy cleric living in Paris. Their intent was to discuss the Uncle's offer to make Alexandre his heir. Rather naively, they traveled via the unsafe route of Dunkirk. Along the way, they were captured by privateers and made prisoners. Once freed, the couple continued the journey.  Alexandre was told he could be considered for a portion of his uncle's estate if he re-joined the Catholic faith. This visit proved fruitless as Alexandre would not give up his religion and return to the Catholic faith. It is of note here that after his conversion to the Huguenot faith, that nothing could sway him from his religious beliefs. His faith had unfortunately proved to be a lifelong roadblock to any consideration of inclusion in any family moneys. </p>\n\n<p>During the years of 1638 -1641 the family was living near Bideford on the border of Devon and Somerset where Elizabeth and Balty were born (the exact location of her birth is debated in Section I above). Alexandre's influence in both the French and English courts had diminished as <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5613/\">Louis XIII</a> had died and Henrietta Marie was now staying in  Paris for a while and would return to live in exile in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>During the beginning of the English Civil War Queen Henrietta formed her own army regiment in England consisting mainly of French soldiers. A Colonel Sir George Goring was the Master of the Queen's Horse and Alexandre was second in command. \"Colonel Goring had commanded an English regiment in the Low Countries under the States of the United Provinces in early 1639 and ... Alexandre ... had been with him on that campaign. In 1643 they fought some battles in the West Country and besieged Bristol. On the 29th March of that year the Queen's forces defeated the Parliamentarians under Sir Thomas Fairfax at Seacroft Moor. At the end of '43 Colonel Goring went to France as Ambassador in Paris to be with his Queen in exile\" (p.19).</p>\n\n<p>In January of 1647, two years prior to the beheading of Charles I, Alexandre was in France, and entered into an episode which would shamefully be reported in the \"Weekly Intelligencer\" of September 30, 1645. Alexandre was Master of the Horse for the King and was a \"firm friend\" with a Mr Wittifield, a Scottish gentleman of Prince Rupert's Horse. During their travels Alexandre won a sum of 60 pistoles from Colonel Sir Thomas Sandy's and Colonel Ambrose Jennings, who were both senior officer to Alexandre.  There was a quarrel that resulted because Sandys would not pay his debt or give Alexandre a bill in writing acknowledging his debt. Sandys feigned that he could not write. This insult brought the parties to a duel.  Alexandre challenged Sandys \"'being come to the Rendevous with their seconds, having charged their pistols, one before the other: at the first discharge Col. Sandys received five bullets into his arm'\" (p.19). Alexandre was hurt and \"fallen down by the fear of his horse, in raising himself struck with his sword the same Colonel in the arm and both the seconds did so well pistol one another that a few hours after they died both. A priest who went by boasted that the said Mr Wittifield whom he exhorted, who professed to be a Protestant had been converted by him and was Roman Catholic\" (p.19-20). This conversion didn't save him and he died anyway. This incident caused Alexandre such disgrace that the family moved back to Paris at the end of that year.</p>\n\n<p>During this same year, Alexandre then took on another avenue of interest and translated <cite>The Life of St. Eustace, martyr</cite> from Italian to French.  In 1647 a Parisian printer named Charles Lambin produced this work.  From here, the financial situation of the family took a turn for the worse as  Balty's letter describes the sad episode of the despondent  Dorothea sending her children into the French nunnery and the boldly infuriated Alexandre pulling them out to bring the family back to England.</p> \n \n<p>After saving them from the nunnery the family went to live in St. Martins in the Fields. During this time \"Alexandre took out patents for curing smoking chimneys, for purifying water, for moulding bricks, and for keeping pond water clean and fit for horses to drink ... Sir John Colladon, the Hugenot physician-in-ordinary to the King, who also lived in St. Martin in the Fields, and Sir Edward Ford of Harting in Sussex were partners with ... Alexandre .. in the patent for curing of smoking chimneys\" (p.13).\n\n<p>Amidst the whirlwind of her father's wild episodes, adventures, misadventures and ongoing feckless inventions, the family \"settled\" into English life with Alexandre basically penniless and having only a distinguished sounding name to his credit. Somehow, Elizabeth and Sam met during this time, Sam being 22 and Elizabeth 15 when they were married. Arthur Bryant points to the Diary to tell us that Sam \"loved her ecstatically, passionately, so that the very intensity of his emotion made him physically sick and he could not rest till he had her. It was all utterly illogical and unreasonable: she was penniless, a mere child, not even his countrywoman, and he himself was without money or prospects\" (Bryant, p.26-27). Somehow, the poor but industrious student Sam brought one thing to the table that could not help but impress Alexandre, a strong and consistent Protestant background. </p>\n\n<p>Sam and Elizabeth were \"married at St. Margarets Church, Westminster. The banns were read on 10th. October and they went before a magistrate on 1st.  December for the civic ceremony which Cromwell's new laws insist upon. Samuel bought ... [Elizabeth] ... a ring at the goldsmiths near the New Exchange and ... [they] ... ate ... [their] ... wedding dinner afterwards on Fish Street Hill.\" (p.13-14).</p>\n\n<p>\"The Register of the church shows the marriage as 'Samuel Peps of this parish, Gent and Elizabeth De Snt Michell of Martins in the ffields, Spinster. Published October 19th., 22nd., 29th. (1655) and were married by Richard Sherwyn Esq. one of the Justices of the Peace for the Cittie and Lyberties of Westminster. December 1st (signed) Ri. Sherwyn' (p.14).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>V. \tHer Voice</h3>\n\n<p>Unless some lucky soul unearths the letters of Elizabeth or some other contemporary manuscript that references her, we are left predominately to draw from the Diary to gain an understanding of a most thought provoking and elusive women. Without the benefit of her perspective, we'll only know her through Sam's Diary entries which reflect a very fluid and ever changing perspective that defines his view of Elizabeth and his opinion about their marriage at any point in time.  </p>\n\n<p>Our annotations can add thoughts to ponder, viewpoints for considerations, creative dialogue to enjoy, lines of poetry, or even perhaps provide a heartfelt laugh at someone's clever witticism. Unfortunately, getting to know and truly understand another person's point of view includes listening to their voice, openly, without judgment and with an empathic heart. Without her voice, at best, we can only imagine who this woman really was, how she experienced her life, what she felt and what was in her heart.  </p>\n\n<p>As we each personally explore the landscape of Elizabeth's life as set forth for us through Sam, and perhaps Balty, we can no doubt benefit from the collective views of similar travelers of the same path. The French writer Marcel Proust reminds us that \"Real travel is not seeing different landscapes with the same eyes, but rather seeing the same landscape with different eyes.\" Where Elizabeth is involved, it seems that the \"destination\" of the journey will most likely never be known, but an openness to share and explore our collective thoughts along the way can add to our pleasure.  This writer would more than welcome corrections, additional \"fact checking\" and the sharing of any Elizabeth and/or her family related findings.  </p>\n\n<p>In spite of this, perhaps the final words and most fitting description of Elizabeth are best left once again, to her husband Sam. The bust at St. Olave's reflects her beauty and was positioned towards the Navy Pew, perhaps with the intent of having her watch over Sam. \"Most fittingly she turns towards the place once occupied by the Navy Pew, and where now is seen Samuel's own monument, erected in 1884\" (Astin, p.84). Her memorial, beautifully worded leaves her with a graceful departure from the world. If historians can not agree on the aspects of her life, the same applies with the translations of Sam's words on her death. In addition to the translations provided below, our annotators have also offered their translations with hopes to better understand Sam's last words for his wife (see the \"people\" background section on Elizabeth Pepys and the May 2, 1663 diary entry comments). As we open our intellectual minds to uncover the denotation of this epitaph, we need to also open our souls to experience the connotation. Some losses so engulf that heart that words are truly insignificant expressions of the emotional anguish left behind.  In many ways it is more comfortable to focus solely on the translation of Sam's \"public\" words as displayed on Elizabeth's epitaph as opposed to even imagine for a moment his \"private\" thoughts and feelings resulting from this loss. We need to consider that Sam's words are not \"complete\" without taking into account the whole, which is the epitaph along with the beauty and liveliness of Elizabeth's spirit as captured in the bust that resides above those words. The combination of these artistic forms may offer a richer experience of who Elizabeth really was. </p>\n\n<p>The Latin original and then Elizabeth's biographer's translations of that transcription follow.  The original Latin inscription below and the first translation are exactly as they appear in Marjorie Astin's <cite>Mrs. Pepys: Her Book</cite> (Astin, p.84-86). Of note, there are some slight variations from the actual plaque:</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          H.  S.

Hopefully this experience of searching for the essence of Elizabeth's voice will leave us open to learn something about ourselves, our perspectives and our judgment of others along the way. The experience of researching her life offers more questions than answers. The topics presented for consideration herein reveal a wide range of differences of opinion among her biographers and Pepysian scholars, many of whom interpret the same information from totally different points of view. What none can debate is that behind the man who was so revealing of his life, thoughts, feelings and flaws remains a most intriguing and elusive woman. Perhaps reading about Elizabeth and looking at her life with empathy and understanding of the world from which she came will move us all collectively to a \"grander world\" view of her, and perhaps our collective selves as human beings.</p>\n\n\n<h3>VI.\tNon-Fiction about Elizabeth</h3>\n\n\n<p>Marjorie Astin's <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite> is a biographical tribute to Elizabeth. In the forward to this book she refers to this work as a \"recital, however simple and unadorned, of her characteristics and surroundings, [which] may constitute a humble yet essential portion of Pepysiana\" (Astin, p.5).  </p>\n\n<p>Patrick Delaforce's <cite>Pepys In Love: Elizabeth's Story</cite> offers expanded background to the St. Michel family with additional information on the life of Elizabeth's father, Alexandre St. Michel. Delaforce tracks the Diary years and then provides details of the trip that the couple took to France after the Diary had closed. Appendix A gives information on the Huguenot links, Appendix B details the Colonel Scott Conspiracy and Appendix C (like Chapell's essay below) entitled <cite>Paintings of Elizabeth -- A Mystery</cite>  provides background on pictures that have been attributed (albeit not always proven) to be Elizabeth. Note that the conflicting classification of this book as both fiction and non-fiction is set forth in Section IV. One additional note: In weighing the decision to include this work as non-fiction I relied on the criteria set forth by Dorrit Cohn in <cite>The Distinction of Fiction</cite>, chapter 2 entitled 'Fictional vs. Historical Lives'. My personal belief is that although Delaforce's book may move towards the \"first person novel/fictional autobiography\" quadrant in it's \"voice\" (first person speakers) that his book truly belongs to be classified as a biography (See Cohn's classification chart, p.19).</p>\n\n<p>Edwin Chappell's <cite>Elizabeth Pepys</cite> appeared in the 1933 in volume 32 of the <cite>Somerset Year-Book</cite>. He articulates the debate over Elizabeth's place of birth and then delves into the question of what she actually looked like. He draws questions about portraits, etc. that have been suggested to be of Elizabeth. Chappell's <cite>Eight Generations of the Pepys Family 1500-1800</cite> lists the genealogy, but only lists Elizabeth as Sam's wife (no other family background for her is provided).</p>\n\n<p>Dora Nothcroft's <cite>Famous Girls of the Past</cite> is a collection of mini-biographies and very general. The reading level is targeted at young readers. </p>\n\n<p>Percival Hunt's <cite>Pepys and Elizabeth Pepys</cite> is an article appearing in his book of essays Samuel Pepys in the Diary and covers the Diary years and the relationship of Sam and Elizabeth.</p>\n\n<p>These books may be located via <a href=\"http://www.usedbooksearch.co.uk/books.htm\">Used Book Search</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Books consulted and/ or quoted for this article</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Astin, Marjorie, <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite>, 1929</li>\n<li>Bryant, Arthur, <cite>Samuel Pepys: The Man in the Making</cite>, 1933 </li>\n<li>Chappell, Edwin, 'Elizabeth Pepys', article from <cite>Somerset Year-Book</cite>, volume 32,  1933</li>\n<li>Chappell, Edwin, <cite>Eight Generations of the Pepys Family History 1500-1800</cite>, 1936</li>\n<li>Cohn, Dorrit,  <cite>The Distinction of Fiction</cite>, 1999</li>\n<li>Delaforce, Patrick,  <cite>Pepys In Love Elizabeth's Story</cite>, 1986</li>\n<li>Heath, Helen Truesdell, <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and his Family Circle</cite>, 1955 </li>\n<li>Hunt, Percival, <cite>Samuel Pepys in the Diary</cite>, 1958</li>\n<li>Northcroft, Dora, <cite>Famous Girls of the Past</cite>,  1966</li>\n<li>Stevenson, Robert Lewis, <cite>Essays, English and American, with introductions notes and\n      illustrations</cite>, 1910, <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Stevenson-pepys.html\">available online</a></li>\n<li>Tomalin, Claire, <cite>Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self</cite>, 2003</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><small>&copy; Jeannine Kerwin, 2006<br />\nThis work is licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5 License</a>.</small></p>\n\n",

            "text_html": "<h3>I.  The Search for Her Voice</h3>\n\n<p>Scholars, historians, writers and curious others have searched for the \"voice\" of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/\">Elizabeth Pepys</a>, only to succumb to the sad realisation that none of her letters or writings exist, or, if in existence, as those die hard optimists may hope, they have yet to be found. Perhaps, like the recently discovered manuscripts of Robert Hooke, some disheveled family will finally clean out an attic, old trunk or cabinet and discover the secrets of her perspective.  In the meantime, Pepysians in search of her secrets have been left to gather their \"evidence\" from Sam's Diary and piece together their interpretations along with the rest of us.</p>\n\n<p>Sam provides an overwhelming window into his life through his collective writings, especially in  his Diary, letters and assorted correspondence.  He is the subject of countless books, articles, essays and fan clubs. The comparison of the vast amount of information presented about him verses the scant whispers of information presented about Elizabeth form a sharp contrast. The search for her voice is quite frankly a dead ended lesson in frustration. Even her \"biographers\" can only offer us at best additional areas of scholarly debate, minimal background information into her family, but never anything more than a hint into her life before Sam.  Those readers hoping to find as a \"destination\" the voice of Elizabeth will no doubt be disappointed, as quite honestly was I, with the limitations of this article. Those who may enjoy the journey as opposed to the destination may walk away with a few thoughts to ponder about this intriguing lady and her family.</p>\n\n<p>Writers see things through their own eyes and not without their own biases. The kindly philosophical Percival Hunt, sees Sam expecting Elizabeth \"to be his wife, and a housekeeper, and a companion, and wise and encouraging. Besides, she was to retire into a cloud when he had work to do, and was to know without telling when to leave him alone. She was, that is, to be all things to one man\" (Hunt, p.167). Richard Ollard's interpretation is that Elizabeth \"consistently shows in the Diary an attractive and unselfish readiness to enter into her husband's interests and to offer him her untutored natural abilities and tastes to shape and direct.\" (Ollard, p.123).... She \"had no power, no resources no friends. Her raison d'etre was to please him. She could make herself disagreeable, but that was all. He held all the cards; money, freedom, social opportunity, and played them for himself. Increasingly this meant that the world he lived in grew apart from hers.\" (Ollard, p.127)\". </p>\n\n<p>A less sympathetic view of Elizabeth includes Bryant description of a young Elizabeth as a totally unsuitable partner for Sam, calling her \"a pale little chit of a foreign beauty who could bring him nothing but trouble,\" (Bryant, p.26) and flatly stating that \"the plain fact remained that she was somewhat of a fool.\" (Bryant, p.28). Robert Lewis Stevenson, who abounds with admiration for Sam reduces Elizabeth simply to \"vulgar\". </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, these \"learned interpretations\" all draw their views from the same place and space that we gather to read each day, Sam's Diary. In order to broaden our view of Elizabeth, who has no voice of her own, perhaps we can gain a better understanding of her through understanding her family life prior to Sam. For this, we need to turn towards the one other person who knew her dearly, has written about her and offered hints as to her life before the Diary. That would be her brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/\">Balty</a>. </p>\n\n<h3>II.  A Letter from Balty</h3>\n\n<p>One of the more famous family letters that is referenced in abundance by Pepysians is a letter that Balty wrote to Sam long after the Diary had come to a close. The background to this letter will help us to weave through its deliberately misleading intent and yet, perhaps reveal the upheaval and instability that Elizabeth knew and called home. </p>\n\n<p>In order to get to her past, we need to jump ahead into the future. Throughout <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">Charles II's</a> reign,  a political plot worked against <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">James</a>, the Duke of York and a number of other Papists in high places (including <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a>). The plot(s) were intended to discredit Catholics who were close to the King, with the hope to gain control of the succession of the Crown. In 1678, these clandestine plans would prove \"personal\" (Heath, p.xiii) and involve Sam, with the hopes to reflect poorly upon his patron, James, the Duke of York. This activity was part of the overall Popish Plots. During this time, the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a well know Protestant magistrate, opened a huge opportunity for the conspirators to blame the Papists for his death.  Helen Heath explains that the original plan may have been to implicate Pepys in the murder of Godfrey. Luckily, Sam was away at the time of the murder so the conspirators went after his clerk, Samuel Atkins. The evidence proved so false that the boy was released, but as a follow up a Colonel John Scott invented evidence against Sam to lead to his arrest on the charges of piracy, popery and treachery. Among the many charges was the one leading to Balty's letter, which stated that Sam had \"secretly turned to the Catholic Church, had hidden crucifixes in his home, [and] had consorted with Catholics\" (Heath, p.xiv). </p>\n\n<p>Sam, now in prison, had a desperate need to clear his name, which involved the need for \"spy\" work be done in France in order to discredit and prove his accuser a liar. To his credit, and, most likely to the amazement of many Diary readers, Balty rose magnificently to the occasion and herein proved his greatest service to Sam. In spite of all his flaws and failures he went to France to pursue \" a sort of double life between the wealthy merchants of Pepys acquaintance, on the one hand, and the rogues and vagabonds who consort with the  nefarious Colonel Scott on the other\" (Heath, p.xxv). </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Balty penned the following letter to Sam, with the intent of \"proving\" that the charge of Popery in his home was false and misleading. Although the readers of the Diary will all know that Elizabeth had a leaning towards Catholicism, the letter provides us with the only other known \"glimpse\" into the family life of the St. Michel's, and therefore holds some of the only other \"hints\" at Elizabeth's life prior to the Diary. This letter is not without controversy, yet it forms the basis that many historians have drawn from to describe her life prior to Sam. Sam's biographers (Chappell, Bryant, Tomilin) and Elizabeth's biographers (Chappell, Delaforce) all reference this  letter, albeit, sometimes drawing conflicting perspectives.  Tomalin does \"warn\" us that Balty \"wrote it down with the specific intention of proving that his sister was a staunch Protestant, whereas it is clear from Pepys's own account that the Catholic faith never lost its hold on her; when, for instance, he bought a mass book for himself in 1660 and sat up late reading it, it gave \"great pleasure to my wife to hear that that she long ago was so well acquainted with\"  (Tomalin, p.55).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the Catholicism issue, the letter causes debate on other grounds as Elizabeth's birthplace is brought into question. Balty will note in this letter that \"Devonsheire at a Place Caled Bidiford, where, and thereabouts my sister and wee all ware borne\" while Edwin Chappell, a noted 19th century Pepysian scholar,  will point out that \"the inscription on her monument in <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/\">St. Olave's Church</a>, Hart Street, E.C., in which is stated that Somerset gave her cradle\" (Chappell, p.33).  Writing for the 1932 Somerset Year-Book, Chapell's article explores the birthplace debate from all angles and finally asks \"may I request that all baptismal registers [in every Somerset parish] for 23rd October, 1640, be inspected, and this interesting point might be definitely settled?\" (Chappell, p.34). It's not clear that this mystery has been conclusively solved to date either. </p>\n\n<p>Another interesting point of debate has to do with the parentage of Elizabeth's mother Dorethea. Marjorie Astin's biography of Elizabeth, which differs on this point from all others (discussed in II and IV), states that Dorethea was the \"daughter of Lavinia and Matthew Penneford of Gort, and widow of Thomas Fleetwood. She was closely connected with the Kingsmills, a family of considerable worth and consequence, who had resided at Basingstoke, Hants, from the twelfth to sixteenth century; they had received a grant from the Royal Mill there, from which they derived their name.\" (Astin, p.10). Perhaps it is best to put these \"details of debate\" into the broader perspective, where through this letter we will see that the results infer that Elizabeth had a \"curious childhood, full of poverty and unrest, for her father was often abroad earning his bread as a soldier.\" (Astin, p.12). </p>\n\n<p>Helen Heath, who edited Pepys' family letters, reminds us in the background information on Balty that \"it is to be noted that life in Balty's eyes is never matter-of-fact. Every wind is a hurricane, every mishap a near-catastrophe, every hardship a hell\" (Heath, p.xxiv). She also sums up this famous letter (Letter #21 of the collection) saying, \"Perhaps the most noteworthy and most informative letter from St. Michel is Letter 21, in which is vividly sketched the family background from which he [Balty] and his sister, Pepys's wife, have emerged. Here is depicted as delightfully erratic a family as anyone could wish to choose a wife from\" (Heath, p.xxiv). We must always remember that no matter how erratic the family and their situation, they were still HER family, and no doubt Elizabeth loved them all and remained devoted to them throughout her life.

Alexandre St. Michel, \"A Gentleman, Extreamely well-bred\"</h3>\n\n<p>Patrick Delaforce, one of Elizabeth's biographers (<cite>Pepys In Love Elizabeth's Story</cite>) draws not only from this famous letter, but also steps outside of the usual \"Pepys\" sources (Wheatley, Bryant, Chappell, etc.)  to bring forth additional background and insights into the life and exploits of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/\">Alexandre de St. Michel</a>, Elizabeth's father.  Delaforce draws this information from the <cite>Huguenot Societies of England and France</cite>, <cite>Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland</cite>, <cite>O'Hart's Irish Pedigrees</cite>, <cite>Memoires du Duc de Sully</cite>, <cite>Journal de Jean Herouard Medecin du Roi (Henry IV et Loius XIII)</cite>, <cite>\"Weekly Intelligencer\"</cite> of September 30, 1645 and the <cite>Duke of Portland MSS</cite> vol. 3 p.150. His sources are cited here as the \"classification\" of his book reflects a \"Biography\" according to the labeling in the book itself (British Library Cataloguing in Publishing Data), where the US Library of Congress lists it in it's online database as historical fiction. The British Library (online) further adds to the confusion by listing it as both biography and fiction. The book is presented through the \"voice\" of Elizabeth (and others). One \"stretching of fact\" in this book is that, in order to tell her story, during her married years, she is sometimes given a broader view into Sam's \"private world\" than what she actually had (ie. more extensive  knowledge of Sam's womanizing activities). Delaforce's insights into the life and exploits of the extremely handsome, wild, restless and always extravagant Alexandre le Marchant, Sieur de St. Michel reflect a uniquely spirited and adventurous rollercoaster of a ride, which may help to provide a better understanding of the formative influences that Elizabeth was born into. The condensed summary below draws solely from Delaforce's chapters on Alexandre (except as noted in one quotation from Bryant), Delaforce deserves full credit for bringing forth this wonderful detail. Anyone interested in reading a more delightful version of the life and times of Alexandre may enjoy actually locating the book (details below). </p>\n\n<p>Alexandre was born in 1593, the only son to the High Sheriff of Bague in France, and the member of a rich and well connected family. His birth came at the time that King Henri IV acceded to the French throne. Unknowing to the young Alexandre, not only would he serve this King, but a total of 3 sovereigns. In 1610, at the age of 17 he was appointed \"Gentilhomme Ordinaire\" to King Henri.  </p>\n\n<p>In May of that year Alexandre was appointed to supervise King Henri's escort in an open carriage through Paris from the Tuileries towards the Arsenal. During the journey the King's guards had lagged behind the carriage, leaving an opening for a young Catholic fanatic to jump out of the crowd, onto the carriage step and to plunge his sword into the King's side. The attack took all by surprise. Alexandre and the guards disarmed the young man. Alexandre took the King to the Duke of Sully's home near the Arsenal. King Henri died almost immediately. Francois Ravaillac, the assassin was put to death within days. </p>\n\n<p>\"Alexandre was still a Catholic then, but a few years later he went to soldier in the Protestant Princes' armies in the Palentinate and Bohemia, where he was converted. At the age of 21 he had failed to regain his inheritance from his father and uncle, but was accepted back into Court and became Gentilhomme Ordinaire to the young King Louis Treize\" (p.16). This King had a love of hunting and chasing game.  One day in May 1624 Alexandre and the King were riding in the countryside outside Fontainbleu. While chasing a large hare in close proximity to a river, the King's horse stumbled and threw him into the deep water. Alexandre jumped from his horse and scooped the King up into his arms from the deep flowing river. He carried the King back to the palace on his horse where he was delivered to the King's doctor, Jean Heroard, who pronounced him unharmed. \"Alexandre may have failed to protect the father, but he certainly saved the son\" (p.16). </p>\n\n<p>After his loyal service to the two Kings he was chosen to serve the daughter of King Henri Quart, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Princess Henrietta Marie</a>. Upon her wedding to <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/\">Charles I</a> in 1625 Alexandre transferred to serve her Court. After her marriage her initial French retinue of about 70 people (mostly housed at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/243/\">Somerset House</a>) swelled to over 400 people, including Alexandre. He served as Gentleman Carver to the Queen and Courier. During this time court scandals abounded (none credited to Alexandre) and Charles I, through the Queen's Lord Chamberlain, sent several hundred of these French families back to France. Although Alexandre was among those sent back, he still maintained his role and provided service to the Queen. This tumultuous year included the start of the siege of the Huguenots at La Rochelle and the English assistance there under the first Duke of Buckingham. </p>\n\n<p>In 1628, the Queen entrusted Alexandre to be the carrier of some valuable gifts from her two sisters (the Princess of Piedmont and Christine, now the wife of the Duke of Savoy). Henrietta had received gifts valued at 200,000 crown, including an Italian chest, crystal glasses, vases, silver and gold cloths. Alexandre was to gather these lavish items and transport them from France to England, which he did successfully. Given the thieves on land and sea, this was no small feat. In a letter to the Duke of Savoy, dated 9 April Henrietta thanked him for the \"'temoignages d'amitie... qu'il lui a envoye... par le Sieur de Saint-Michel.' He carried out many such missions for the Queen both in England and France\" (p.17).</p>\n\n<p>The Queen was a devout and unbending Catholic. Alexandre had been born and raised a Catholic and was wise enough not to flaunt his conversion. Apparently the entourage of priests surrounding the Queen was not so complaisant as to look the other way and over time a physical confrontation of sorts took place between Alexandre and one of the monks. His position of Gentleman Carver was taken from him. He was given the role of Captain of the Queen's Horse and his career took a shift towards the army. </p>\n\n<p>Around 1632 Alexandre was serving in the army in Ireland where he met his soon to be wife (Elizabeth's mother) <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/\">Dorothea</a>. She was born in 1605 and was the youngest child of Sir Francis Kingsmill, who had been knighted in Dublin in 1603 [note that this point regarding Dorethea's  parentage differs from Astin's  set forth above, but Delaforce presents the most commonly expressed heritage, which is consistent with Balty's letter]. Dorothea had initially married Thomas Fleetwood in 1620. He had died in 1632 leaving her a widow with two children [of note, no reference is made again to these children, so it is not known if they were left behind in the care of  the late father's, or Dorothea's  family or if they died in their youth]. Dorothea (now 30) was charmed by Alexandre (now 42) and the two were married, much to the strong objections of her family.  The marriage left her in the sad position of being cut out of all of the family wills and put her welfare solely into the care of her husband (and over time, as we will painfully see to the generosity of her one day son-in-law Sam). </p>\n\n<p>The married couple decided to visit Alexandre's uncle, a wealthy cleric living in Paris. Their intent was to discuss the Uncle's offer to make Alexandre his heir. Rather naively, they traveled via the unsafe route of Dunkirk. Along the way, they were captured by privateers and made prisoners. Once freed, the couple continued the journey.  Alexandre was told he could be considered for a portion of his uncle's estate if he re-joined the Catholic faith. This visit proved fruitless as Alexandre would not give up his religion and return to the Catholic faith. It is of note here that after his conversion to the Huguenot faith, that nothing could sway him from his religious beliefs. His faith had unfortunately proved to be a lifelong roadblock to any consideration of inclusion in any family moneys. </p>\n\n<p>During the years of 1638 -1641 the family was living near Bideford on the border of Devon and Somerset where Elizabeth and Balty were born (the exact location of her birth is debated in Section I above). Alexandre's influence in both the French and English courts had diminished as <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5613/\">Louis XIII</a> had died and Henrietta Marie was now staying in  Paris for a while and would return to live in exile in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>During the beginning of the English Civil War Queen Henrietta formed her own army regiment in England consisting mainly of French soldiers. A Colonel Sir George Goring was the Master of the Queen's Horse and Alexandre was second in command. \"Colonel Goring had commanded an English regiment in the Low Countries under the States of the United Provinces in early 1639 and ... Alexandre ... had been with him on that campaign. In 1643 they fought some battles in the West Country and besieged Bristol. On the 29th March of that year the Queen's forces defeated the Parliamentarians under Sir Thomas Fairfax at Seacroft Moor. At the end of '43 Colonel Goring went to France as Ambassador in Paris to be with his Queen in exile\" (p.19).</p>\n\n<p>In January of 1647, two years prior to the beheading of Charles I, Alexandre was in France, and entered into an episode which would shamefully be reported in the \"Weekly Intelligencer\" of September 30, 1645. Alexandre was Master of the Horse for the King and was a \"firm friend\" with a Mr Wittifield, a Scottish gentleman of Prince Rupert's Horse. During their travels Alexandre won a sum of 60 pistoles from Colonel Sir Thomas Sandy's and Colonel Ambrose Jennings, who were both senior officer to Alexandre.  There was a quarrel that resulted because Sandys would not pay his debt or give Alexandre a bill in writing acknowledging his debt. Sandys feigned that he could not write. This insult brought the parties to a duel.  Alexandre challenged Sandys \"'being come to the Rendevous with their seconds, having charged their pistols, one before the other: at the first discharge Col. Sandys received five bullets into his arm'\" (p.19). Alexandre was hurt and \"fallen down by the fear of his horse, in raising himself struck with his sword the same Colonel in the arm and both the seconds did so well pistol one another that a few hours after they died both. A priest who went by boasted that the said Mr Wittifield whom he exhorted, who professed to be a Protestant had been converted by him and was Roman Catholic\" (p.19-20). This conversion didn't save him and he died anyway. This incident caused Alexandre such disgrace that the family moved back to Paris at the end of that year.</p>\n\n<p>During this same year, Alexandre then took on another avenue of interest and translated <cite>The Life of St. Eustace, martyr</cite> from Italian to French.  In 1647 a Parisian printer named Charles Lambin produced this work.  From here, the financial situation of the family took a turn for the worse as  Balty's letter describes the sad episode of the despondent  Dorothea sending her children into the French nunnery and the boldly infuriated Alexandre pulling them out to bring the family back to England.</p>\n\n<p>After saving them from the nunnery the family went to live in St. Martins in the Fields. During this time \"Alexandre took out patents for curing smoking chimneys, for purifying water, for moulding bricks, and for keeping pond water clean and fit for horses to drink ... Sir John Colladon, the Hugenot physician-in-ordinary to the King, who also lived in St. Martin in the Fields, and Sir Edward Ford of Harting in Sussex were partners with ... Alexandre .. in the patent for curing of smoking chimneys\" (p.13).\n\n<p>Amidst the whirlwind of her father's wild episodes, adventures, misadventures and ongoing feckless inventions, the family \"settled\" into English life with Alexandre basically penniless and having only a distinguished sounding name to his credit. Somehow, Elizabeth and Sam met during this time, Sam being 22 and Elizabeth 15 when they were married. Arthur Bryant points to the Diary to tell us that Sam \"loved her ecstatically, passionately, so that the very intensity of his emotion made him physically sick and he could not rest till he had her. It was all utterly illogical and unreasonable: she was penniless, a mere child, not even his countrywoman, and he himself was without money or prospects\" (Bryant, p.26-27). Somehow, the poor but industrious student Sam brought one thing to the table that could not help but impress Alexandre, a strong and consistent Protestant background. </p>\n\n<p>Sam and Elizabeth were \"married at St. Margarets Church, Westminster. The banns were read on 10th. October and they went before a magistrate on 1st.  December for the civic ceremony which Cromwell's new laws insist upon. Samuel bought ... [Elizabeth] ... a ring at the goldsmiths near the New Exchange and ... [they] ... ate ... [their] ... wedding dinner afterwards on Fish Street Hill.\" (p.13-14).</p>\n\n<p>\"The Register of the church shows the marriage as 'Samuel Peps of this parish, Gent and Elizabeth De Snt Michell of Martins in the ffields, Spinster. Published October 19th., 22nd., 29th. (1655) and were married by Richard Sherwyn Esq. one of the Justices of the Peace for the Cittie and Lyberties of Westminster. December 1st (signed) Ri. Sherwyn' (p.14).</p>\n\n<h3>V.  Her Voice</h3>\n\n<p>Unless some lucky soul unearths the letters of Elizabeth or some other contemporary manuscript that references her, we are left predominately to draw from the Diary to gain an understanding of a most thought provoking and elusive women. Without the benefit of her perspective, we'll only know her through Sam's Diary entries which reflect a very fluid and ever changing perspective that defines his view of Elizabeth and his opinion about their marriage at any point in time.  </p>\n\n<p>Our annotations can add thoughts to ponder, viewpoints for considerations, creative dialogue to enjoy, lines of poetry, or even perhaps provide a heartfelt laugh at someone's clever witticism. Unfortunately, getting to know and truly understand another person's point of view includes listening to their voice, openly, without judgment and with an empathic heart. Without her voice, at best, we can only imagine who this woman really was, how she experienced her life, what she felt and what was in her heart.  </p>\n\n<p>As we each personally explore the landscape of Elizabeth's life as set forth for us through Sam, and perhaps Balty, we can no doubt benefit from the collective views of similar travelers of the same path. The French writer Marcel Proust reminds us that \"Real travel is not seeing different landscapes with the same eyes, but rather seeing the same landscape with different eyes.\" Where Elizabeth is involved, it seems that the \"destination\" of the journey will most likely never be known, but an openness to share and explore our collective thoughts along the way can add to our pleasure.  This writer would more than welcome corrections, additional \"fact checking\" and the sharing of any Elizabeth and/or her family related findings.  </p>\n\n<p>In spite of this, perhaps the final words and most fitting description of Elizabeth are best left once again, to her husband Sam. The bust at St. Olave's reflects her beauty and was positioned towards the Navy Pew, perhaps with the intent of having her watch over Sam. \"Most fittingly she turns towards the place once occupied by the Navy Pew, and where now is seen Samuel's own monument, erected in 1884\" (Astin, p.84). Her memorial, beautifully worded leaves her with a graceful departure from the world. If historians can not agree on the aspects of her life, the same applies with the translations of Sam's words on her death. In addition to the translations provided below, our annotators have also offered their translations with hopes to better understand Sam's last words for his wife (see the \"people\" background section on Elizabeth Pepys and the May 2, 1663 diary entry comments). As we open our intellectual minds to uncover the denotation of this epitaph, we need to also open our souls to experience the connotation. Some losses so engulf that heart that words are truly insignificant expressions of the emotional anguish left behind.  In many ways it is more comfortable to focus solely on the translation of Sam's \"public\" words as displayed on Elizabeth's epitaph as opposed to even imagine for a moment his \"private\" thoughts and feelings resulting from this loss. We need to consider that Sam's words are not \"complete\" without taking into account the whole, which is the epitaph along with the beauty and liveliness of Elizabeth's spirit as captured in the bust that resides above those words. The combination of these artistic forms may offer a richer experience of who Elizabeth really was. </p>\n\n<p>The Latin original and then Elizabeth's biographer's translations of that transcription follow.

Hopefully this experience of searching for the essence of Elizabeth's voice will leave us open to learn something about ourselves, our perspectives and our judgment of others along the way. The experience of researching her life offers more questions than answers. The topics presented for consideration herein reveal a wide range of differences of opinion among her biographers and Pepysian scholars, many of whom interpret the same information from totally different points of view. What none can debate is that behind the man who was so revealing of his life, thoughts, feelings and flaws remains a most intriguing and elusive woman. Perhaps reading about Elizabeth and looking at her life with empathy and understanding of the world from which she came will move us all collectively to a \"grander world\" view of her, and perhaps our collective selves as human beings.</p>\n\n<h3>VI. Non-Fiction about Elizabeth</h3>\n\n<p>Marjorie Astin's <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite> is a biographical tribute to Elizabeth. In the forward to this book she refers to this work as a \"recital, however simple and unadorned, of her characteristics and surroundings, [which] may constitute a humble yet essential portion of Pepysiana\" (Astin, p.5).  </p>\n\n<p>Patrick Delaforce's <cite>Pepys In Love: Elizabeth's Story</cite> offers expanded background to the St. Michel family with additional information on the life of Elizabeth's father, Alexandre St. Michel. Delaforce tracks the Diary years and then provides details of the trip that the couple took to France after the Diary had closed. Appendix A gives information on the Huguenot links, Appendix B details the Colonel Scott Conspiracy and Appendix C (like Chapell's essay below) entitled <cite>Paintings of Elizabeth -- A Mystery</cite>  provides background on pictures that have been attributed (albeit not always proven) to be Elizabeth. Note that the conflicting classification of this book as both fiction and non-fiction is set forth in Section IV. One additional note: In weighing the decision to include this work as non-fiction I relied on the criteria set forth by Dorrit Cohn in <cite>The Distinction of Fiction</cite>, chapter 2 entitled 'Fictional vs. Historical Lives'. My personal belief is that although Delaforce's book may move towards the \"first person novel/fictional autobiography\" quadrant in it's \"voice\" (first person speakers) that his book truly belongs to be classified as a biography (See Cohn's classification chart, p.19).</p>\n\n<p>Edwin Chappell's <cite>Elizabeth Pepys</cite> appeared in the 1933 in volume 32 of the <cite>Somerset Year-Book</cite>. He articulates the debate over Elizabeth's place of birth and then delves into the question of what she actually looked like. He draws questions about portraits, etc. that have been suggested to be of Elizabeth. Chappell's <cite>Eight Generations of the Pepys Family 1500-1800</cite> lists the genealogy, but only lists Elizabeth as Sam's wife (no other family background for her is provided).</p>\n\n<p>Dora Nothcroft's <cite>Famous Girls of the Past</cite> is a collection of mini-biographies and very general. The reading level is targeted at young readers. </p>\n\n<p>Percival Hunt's <cite>Pepys and Elizabeth Pepys</cite> is an article appearing in his book of essays Samuel Pepys in the Diary and covers the Diary years and the relationship of Sam and Elizabeth.</p>\n\n<p>These books may be located via <a href=\"http://www.usedbooksearch.co.uk/books.htm\">Used Book Search</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Books consulted and/ or quoted for this article</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Astin, Marjorie, <cite>Mrs Pepys Her Book</cite>, 1929</li>\n<li>Bryant, Arthur, <cite>Samuel Pepys: The Man in the Making</cite>, 1933 </li>\n<li>Chappell, Edwin, 'Elizabeth Pepys', article from <cite>Somerset Year-Book</cite>, volume 32,  1933</li>\n<li>Chappell, Edwin, <cite>Eight Generations of the Pepys Family History 1500-1800</cite>, 1936</li>\n<li>Cohn, Dorrit,  <cite>The Distinction of Fiction</cite>, 1999</li>\n<li>Delaforce, Patrick,  <cite>Pepys In Love Elizabeth's Story</cite>, 1986</li>\n<li>Heath, Helen Truesdell, <cite>The Letters of Samuel Pepys and his Family Circle</cite>, 1955 </li>\n<li>Hunt, Percival, <cite>Samuel Pepys in the Diary</cite>, 1958</li>\n<li>Northcroft, Dora, <cite>Famous Girls of the Past</cite>,  1966</li>\n<li>Stevenson, Robert Lewis, <cite>Essays, English and American, with introductions notes and\n      illustrations</cite>, 1910, <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Stevenson-pepys.html\">available online</a></li>\n<li>Tomalin, Claire, <cite>Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self</cite>, 2003</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><small>&copy; Jeannine Kerwin, 2006<br />\nThis work is licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5 License</a>.</small></p>",

            "text": "<p>This letter is from Sam to his father, John Pepys. John is sixty-two years of age when he receives this letter. John's elder brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/884/\">Robert</a> had left the major portion of his estate to John, \"slighting an intermediate brother, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2542/\">Thomas</a>, to whom and to whose married sister he left only annuities\" (page 1, note 4). This estate came with a double-edged sword as it included not only the property, but its debts and responsibilities. At the time of this letter, John is currently living in Brampton and has left his tailor shop to his son <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/\">Thomas</a>. John visited Sam in April 1663 to discuss the financial situation of the estate.  \"Samuel, after a study of the tangled records, has drawn up a programme of economy for his parents and a schedule of benevolence for\" (p. xix) their consideration.</p> \n\n<p>Heath's text is directly from the manuscript. This letter is from the Rawlinson Collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, in the Admiralty volumes of the Pepysian Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. She notes that for this specific letter there is a reference to a listing of funds owing to the estate which is not included herein as it is not found among the Rawlinson MS.  The \"enclosed accompt\" of the rents referred to in the letter is included as the second item presented herein. Additional notes explain that <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2809/\">Will Stankes</a>, who is mentioned in the letter, is the baliff of the Brampton estates. Her note 2 on page 2 explains that \"<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2784/\">Tom Trice</a> was Uncle Robert's foster-son, by a marriage in 1630 with Ann Trice, a widow with seven children. The will excludes her specifically by reason of alleged fraud in the marriage settlement. A caveat against the estate was being entered in her name by her two sons, Tom and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2813/\">Jasper Trice</a>.\"  The reference to the \"Wardrob's plase\" is a reference to the position of the Master of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/946/\">the Wardrobe</a>, which was among the positions granted by Charles II to Sam's cousin, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Lord Sandwich</a>. \"Sam had secured that the post of Yeoman Tailor in this establishment might revert to his father when it should next fall vacant\" (p. 2, note 3).  </p>\n\n<p>The formatting of the schedule of rents at Brampton does not exactly reflect the original as it appeared in Ms. Heath's collection. Sam had grouped the sections a little differently and had written the titles to each section in the left and/or right margins. In addition some of the numbers had \".\" after them and some did not. This undated document was referenced in the letter to his father and included with it.  The content is from the original and, as the letter it is attached to, is presented in full.</p>\n\n<h3>I .\tSam's Letter to His Father</h3>\n\n<p><em>This letter was an original, with red wax seal. Holograph. Endorsed: \"May 16, 1663. The Present Generall State of Our affaires at Bramton, given my Father for his future direction therein. S.P.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>May 16, 1663</p>\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n\n<p>believing that the wearysomeness of your late journy is by this time throughly over, and being unwilling to delay the stateing to you in writing the present posture of our affaires for a guide to you in your future expences (which for the time to come I hope you will understand it to bee necessary by all ways possible to lessen) I have thought fitt to take this time of doeing it, and in the first place must reminde you, that after our many great disbursements upon Repayres, funeral charges, paying of debts and legacys, and a deare housekeeping there remaynes yet behinde, Six hundred and fifteene pounds unpayd in debts and Legacys; Towards which wee have comeing to us by your hands and myne according to the perticulers mentioned in a paper annexed -- 376 &pound; 09 s 00d, which as fast it comes in is to bee employed towards the payment of the aforesayd Debt. And there will remayne to bee provided for, the sum of 238 &pound; 11s 00d more then wee have any mony comeing to us to make good, but what shall arise out of the rents of the estate. </p>\n\n<p>Now the Rents of the estate, which remaynes unsold to at this day amount to 75&pound;, 09s, 00d per annum all taxes and charges deducted, as by the enclosed accompt you will perticularly see. Out of which 75&pound; 09s 00d wee being pay 25&pound; to my uncle Thomas and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6215/\">Aunt Perkins</a>, there will rest but 50&pound; and 9s per annum towards your maintenance and the payment of the above-sayd debt of 238&pound; 11s 00, which debt however seeing it must be payd soone or late and that wee may the sooner bee ridd of all trouble and clamours, wee did at your being here conclude it necessary to sell <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2822/\">Sturtlow</a>, which by Will Stankes's reckoning may yeeld 480&pound; out of which my Brother Thomas may bee supplyed with 200&pound; for his share (which will bee a very plentifull provision for him) and pay the debt of 238&pound; 11s 00, besides a remayner of 41&pound; 09s 00d, which it is too probable wee shall have occasions enough of laying out in charges of Courts, repayres and following the law against Tom Trice, with other charges I cannot now thinke of .</p>\n\n<p>But that which follows next to be considered is how you and my mother shall be maintayned out of what remaynes when Sturtlow is sold which will bee but 29&pound; per annum. This I confesse is a very sad consideration, That after soe much expectation, trouble and removing your selfe from a better condition you should finde noe better provision made for you then a house to live in and 29 &pound; a yeare. But Sir as it helpes us nothing to afflict ourselfe for what wee cannot prevent, soe doth it concerne us more to study how to improve the best wee can that little which is left. And that I may not appeare wanting to the best of my ability to encourage and assist you herein, I am contented to make up the losse of Sturtlow to you out of my owne purse, so that you may have entire 50&pound; a yeare to live upon, till by the death of my uncle Thomas, or the falling of the Wardrob's plase it may bee raysed to you some other way. You cannot but thinke that for mee to part with twenty pounds a yeare out of my purse in steade of haveing 30&pound; a yeare and the rent of Sturtlow as the Will gives mee is an unwellcome burthen; but Sir I have two designes (besides my duty in generall to bee assisting to you) which if I bee not disappointed in I shall thinke my parting with that Summe very well bestowed. </p>\n\n \t<p>1. I would by this oblige <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/\">my mother</a> and you to the study of thrift and quietnesse, that I may heare noe more of those differences, which to my great griefe I have of late understood doe often arise betweene you. From whence they come I know not, nor am willing to enquire, But this I know, that it did not use to bee soe, not I trust in god will bee here after, there being nothing that I can hope or doe wish for you more, then that the abatement of your plenty may bee made up in the encrease of your peace. </p>\n\n\t<p>2. I hope hereby not only my selfe to bee at a certainty, what it is that I must provide to spare out of my owne expences for you, but you alsoe when you shall see thoroughly what it is and noe more that you can expect either from the estate, or mee, will not (as you have hitherto) spend at a guesse but will bee able at every months or Quarters end to tell, whether you doe excede or come within your allowance.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>And I must needs further say, that considering you live rent free, and I hope free from any future charge for my Brother John or any of your Children but <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/\">Pall</a>, that 50 &pound; a yeare will bee thought a good competence. Especially if all ways of thrift bee studyed, as I hope you will all thinke it necessary from hence forward to doe. And by the way lett mee tell you, that if I understand any thing of thrift, it cannot be any good husbandry to such a family as yours to keepe either hoggs, poultry, sheepe, cowes, (or horses more than one) there being meate of all sorts, milke, butter, cheese eggs fowle and every thing elce to bee had cheaper and I am sure with more quiet at the market, if not at your doore, then for you to keep them besides the danger of theyr dying or being stolne. This I desire you and my mother to consider of, and if you judge it as I doe to bee good husbandry, then not to scruple the parting with them upon any other pretences, but sell them off; by which, being now on even ground and the rents from <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/557/\">Lady day</a> last comeing to you, you will bee the better able to spare the other monys mentioned in the enclosed paper for the payment of Debts and Legacys, without which we shall never bee able to cleare our selfes thereof. </p>\n\t\n\t<p>But if after all this you shall finde, that 50&pound; per annum will not doe; I beleive you cannot but know that for that mony you and mother may bee boarded well either in City or Country and (Pall being placed abroad in some good service) spend your days without further cares or charge.\nAll this I doe earnestly recommend to your selfe and my mother to consider of, it being the greatest wish I have in the world, that by my advice and purse (soe farr as I can without wrong to her whom I am obliged to make provision for) I may bee able to assist you in makeing such provision for you as may enable you to passe the remaynder of your time with a sufficiency of estate and ease. Soe craving your blessing I remayne</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your ever obedient Sonn<br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSAMUEL PEPYS</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>I have sent you alsoe herein a Copy of Severall lands wee have in Brampton, how they are lett and to whom, that you may see what the rents of the whole come to, and what the taxes and other charges thereupon doe amount to. <br />\nFor my father.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>II.

In this letter and the estate summary, Sam has set forth a proposed plan for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/\">his father's</a> consideration regarding the settlement of the Brampton estate.

            "text_html": "<p>This letter is from Sam to his father, John Pepys. John is sixty-two years of age when he receives this letter. John's elder brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/884/\">Robert</a> had left the major portion of his estate to John, \"slighting an intermediate brother, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2542/\">Thomas</a>, to whom and to whose married sister he left only annuities\" (page 1, note 4). This estate came with a double-edged sword as it included not only the property, but its debts and responsibilities. At the time of this letter, John is currently living in Brampton and has left his tailor shop to his son <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/\">Thomas</a>. John visited Sam in April 1663 to discuss the financial situation of the estate.  \"Samuel, after a study of the tangled records, has drawn up a programme of economy for his parents and a schedule of benevolence for\" (p. xix) their consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Heath's text is directly from the manuscript. This letter is from the Rawlinson Collection in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, in the Admiralty volumes of the Pepysian Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. She notes that for this specific letter there is a reference to a listing of funds owing to the estate which is not included herein as it is not found among the Rawlinson MS.  The \"enclosed accompt\" of the rents referred to in the letter is included as the second item presented herein. Additional notes explain that <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2809/\">Will Stankes</a>, who is mentioned in the letter, is the baliff of the Brampton estates. Her note 2 on page 2 explains that \"<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2784/\">Tom Trice</a> was Uncle Robert's foster-son, by a marriage in 1630 with Ann Trice, a widow with seven children. The will excludes her specifically by reason of alleged fraud in the marriage settlement. A caveat against the estate was being entered in her name by her two sons, Tom and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2813/\">Jasper Trice</a>.\"  The reference to the \"Wardrob's plase\" is a reference to the position of the Master of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/946/\">the Wardrobe</a>, which was among the positions granted by Charles II to Sam's cousin, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/\">Lord Sandwich</a>. \"Sam had secured that the post of Yeoman Tailor in this establishment might revert to his father when it should next fall vacant\" (p. 2, note 3).  </p>\n\n<p>The formatting of the schedule of rents at Brampton does not exactly reflect the original as it appeared in Ms. Heath's collection. Sam had grouped the sections a little differently and had written the titles to each section in the left and/or right margins. In addition some of the numbers had \".\" after them and some did not. This undated document was referenced in the letter to his father and included with it.  The content is from the original and, as the letter it is attached to, is presented in full.</p>\n\n<h3>I . Sam's Letter to His Father</h3>\n\n<p><em>This letter was an original, with red wax seal. Holograph. Endorsed: \"May 16, 1663. The Present Generall State of Our affaires at Bramton, given my Father for his future direction therein. S.P.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>May 16, 1663</p>\n\n<p>Sir,</p>\n\n<p>believing that the wearysomeness of your late journy is by this time throughly over, and being unwilling to delay the stateing to you in writing the present posture of our affaires for a guide to you in your future expences (which for the time to come I hope you will understand it to bee necessary by all ways possible to lessen) I have thought fitt to take this time of doeing it, and in the first place must reminde you, that after our many great disbursements upon Repayres, funeral charges, paying of debts and legacys, and a deare housekeeping there remaynes yet behinde, Six hundred and fifteene pounds unpayd in debts and Legacys; Towards which wee have comeing to us by your hands and myne according to the perticulers mentioned in a paper annexed -- 376 &pound; 09 s 00d, which as fast it comes in is to bee employed towards the payment of the aforesayd Debt. And there will remayne to bee provided for, the sum of 238 &pound; 11s 00d more then wee have any mony comeing to us to make good, but what shall arise out of the rents of the estate. </p>\n\n<p>Now the Rents of the estate, which remaynes unsold to at this day amount to 75&pound;, 09s, 00d per annum all taxes and charges deducted, as by the enclosed accompt you will perticularly see. Out of which 75&pound; 09s 00d wee being pay 25&pound; to my uncle Thomas and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6215/\">Aunt Perkins</a>, there will rest but 50&pound; and 9s per annum towards your maintenance and the payment of the above-sayd debt of 238&pound; 11s 00, which debt however seeing it must be payd soone or late and that wee may the sooner bee ridd of all trouble and clamours, wee did at your being here conclude it necessary to sell <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2822/\">Sturtlow</a>, which by Will Stankes's reckoning may yeeld 480&pound; out of which my Brother Thomas may bee supplyed with 200&pound; for his share (which will bee a very plentifull provision for him) and pay the debt of 238&pound; 11s 00, besides a remayner of 41&pound; 09s 00d, which it is too probable wee shall have occasions enough of laying out in charges of Courts, repayres and following the law against Tom Trice, with other charges I cannot now thinke of .</p>\n\n<p>But that which follows next to be considered is how you and my mother shall be maintayned out of what remaynes when Sturtlow is sold which will bee but 29&pound; per annum. This I confesse is a very sad consideration, That after soe much expectation, trouble and removing your selfe from a better condition you should finde noe better provision made for you then a house to live in and 29 &pound; a yeare. But Sir as it helpes us nothing to afflict ourselfe for what wee cannot prevent, soe doth it concerne us more to study how to improve the best wee can that little which is left. And that I may not appeare wanting to the best of my ability to encourage and assist you herein, I am contented to make up the losse of Sturtlow to you out of my owne purse, so that you may have entire 50&pound; a yeare to live upon, till by the death of my uncle Thomas, or the falling of the Wardrob's plase it may bee raysed to you some other way. You cannot but thinke that for mee to part with twenty pounds a yeare out of my purse in steade of haveing 30&pound; a yeare and the rent of Sturtlow as the Will gives mee is an unwellcome burthen; but Sir I have two designes (besides my duty in generall to bee assisting to you) which if I bee not disappointed in I shall thinke my parting with that Summe very well bestowed. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;1. I would by this oblige &lt;a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/\"&gt;my mother&lt;/a&gt; and you to the study of thrift and quietnesse, that I may heare noe more of those differences, which to my great griefe I have of late understood doe often arise betweene you. From whence they come I know not, nor am willing to enquire, But this I know, that it did not use to bee soe, not I trust in god will bee here after, there being nothing that I can hope or doe wish for you more, then that the abatement of your plenty may bee made up in the encrease of your peace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2. I hope hereby not only my selfe to bee at a certainty, what it is that I must provide to spare out of my owne expences for you, but you alsoe when you shall see thoroughly what it is and noe more that you can expect either from the estate, or mee, will not (as you have hitherto) spend at a guesse but will bee able at every months or Quarters end to tell, whether you doe excede or come within your allowance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I must needs further say, that considering you live rent free, and I hope free from any future charge for my Brother John or any of your Children but &lt;a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/\"&gt;Pall&lt;/a&gt;, that 50 &amp;pound; a yeare will bee thought a good competence. Especially if all ways of thrift bee studyed, as I hope you will all thinke it necessary from hence forward to doe. And by the way lett mee tell you, that if I understand any thing of thrift, it cannot be any good husbandry to such a family as yours to keepe either hoggs, poultry, sheepe, cowes, (or horses more than one) there being meate of all sorts, milke, butter, cheese eggs fowle and every thing elce to bee had cheaper and I am sure with more quiet at the market, if not at your doore, then for you to keep them besides the danger of theyr dying or being stolne. This I desire you and my mother to consider of, and if you judge it as I doe to bee good husbandry, then not to scruple the parting with them upon any other pretences, but sell them off; by which, being now on even ground and the rents from &lt;a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/557/\"&gt;Lady day&lt;/a&gt; last comeing to you, you will bee the better able to spare the other monys mentioned in the enclosed paper for the payment of Debts and Legacys, without which we shall never bee able to cleare our selfes thereof. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if after all this you shall finde, that 50&amp;pound; per annum will not doe; I beleive you cannot but know that for that mony you and mother may bee boarded well either in City or Country and (Pall being placed abroad in some good service) spend your days without further cares or charge.\n</code></pre>\n<p>All this I doe earnestly recommend to your selfe and my mother to consider of, it being the greatest wish I have in the world, that by my advice and purse (soe farr as I can without wrong to her whom I am obliged to make provision for) I may bee able to assist you in makeing such provision for you as may enable you to passe the remaynder of your time with a sufficiency of estate and ease. Soe craving your blessing I remayne</p></p>\n<pre><code>                    &lt;p&gt;Your ever obedient Sonn&lt;br /&gt;\n                    SAMUEL PEPYS&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have sent you alsoe herein a Copy of Severall lands wee have in Brampton, how they are lett and to whom, that you may see what the rents of the whole come to, and what the taxes and other charges thereupon doe amount to. <br />\nFor my father.</p>\n\n<h3>II.

            "title": "The Journal of \"My Lord\" Sandwich", 
            "text": "<p>Pepys writes \"My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world, that could give an offence to any, and with the great honour he thought it would be to him.\" As the annotators went about their discussion of the entry, one notation in particular provided a most thoughtful glimpse into the question of the more personal side of Lord Sandwich. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/05/25/#5028\">Mary wrote</a>,  \"This is the first truly personal glimpse that we have had of Mountagu, whose presentation is normally very deferential and leads the reader to assume that he is much older and more 'mature' than Sam. It reminds us that there is very little age difference between Sam and his master; there is a matter of only 7 or 8 years between them.\"</p>\n\n<p>While Sam's diary captures a uniquely diverse and expansive view of 17th century life, Claire Tomalin's biography of Pepys explains that Sandwich's journals \"were largely official and impersonal and altogether different from what Pepys\" wrote in his diary. (p.81). She further explains that as a \"high official serving the state, [he] had good reason to keep records of ... [his] ... meetings and travel\" (p.78)  and the style of his affords more of a formal approach in the manner of his writing.</p>\n\n<p>R. C. Anderson, who edited the <cite>Journals of the Earl of Sandwich</cite> (herein the Journal)  covering the period of 1659-1665, tells us that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>All of his Journal that relates to his activities as a naval commander is contained in a single volume, which covers the period 12th March 1658/9 to 13th September 1665, when he returned to the Nore from the final short, but successful, cruise of that year in the North Sea. His journal as second in command of the fleet in 1672 probably perished with him in the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3124/\">Royal James</a>; at any rate, it is not preserved at Hinchingbrooke with the rest of his papers.</p>\n\n\t<p>During the years 1659-1665 his work afloat was varied and important; including, as it did, the expedition to the Sound, the Restoration, the operations against Algiers, the acquisition of Tangier, the home-coming of the new Queen, [historical spoilers follow] the mobilisation of 1664, the battle of Lowestoft, the failure at Bergen, and the capture of the Dutch East-Indiamen in 1665. The list is a long one, covering nearly the whole of the more important work of the Navy for those years, and in every case save one Sandwich was the leading figure.</p>\n\n\t<p>For the most part his journal is in his own writing. Even where this is not the case, notably in the first section relating to the voyage to Denmark, there are frequent additions and corrections by his own hand.  One of the most noticeable things about it is the evidence that he took far more interest in the purely nautical side of his profession than one would expect of a young 'gentleman admiral'.....  [and] there is abundance of evidence that Sandwich did his own navigation while at sea and spent a great deal of time in harbour in surveying work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(pp. ix-x)</p>\n\n<p>Anderson also points out that that what is missing (which is found in abundance in Sam's diary) is anything \"of a personal nature.\" A case in point is that the Index to the <cite>Journal</cite> contains 10 pages of named ships and only 8 rather minor references to Sam.  Sandwich's journal and his personal life were two separate entities and rarely did his journal provide insight into him as 'a person'. That being said, perhaps a few entries prior to 1663, capture a glimpse of his sense of excitement, wonder and interest in the world around him. The three Journal sections below include the Restoration of Charles II, the preparations of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a> for her trip to England, and a bullfight that perhaps comes the \"closest\" in writing style to any of Sam's diary entries. A short introduction will be given to each to putting entry into perspective followed by the entry in Sandwich's own words.</p>\n\n<h3>I. The King</h3>\n\n<p>For the final stages of the Restoration, Mountagu (not yet Lord Sandwich) returned from his 'retirement' at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/\">Hinchingbrooke</a> and was reappointed General of the fleet together with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/\">Monk</a>. While Monk maintained order ashore, Mountagu embarked to prepare the fleet for its coming duty of bringing back the King.  Although Mountagu is making history with this voyage, his entries records the details of the day without any indication of crediting himself for pulling this off. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/05/23/\">May 23 1660</a>, the King finally set foot upon Mountagu's ship the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/462/\">Naseby</a>. The entry reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>23rd. Wednesday. In the morning the General went in his barge close to the shore-side at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/824/\">Schevelinge</a>, where was prepared a Dutch vessel to carry His Majesty on board the Naseby, and about ten of the clock in the morning the King's most sacred Majesty came to the shore-side and boarded the said vessel, but before she was launched from the shore his Majesty went off her into the Rear Admiral's boat and came presently on board the General's barge, as did also the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Dukes of York</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/829/\">Gloucester</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/803/\">Princess Royal</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/833/\">Queen of Bohemia</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/\">Prince of Orange</a>, and so were rowed from the Naseby, which ship they boarded about eleven of the clock in the morning.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>There were upon the shore at Schevelinge many troops of horse and foot of the States, and about forty pieces of ordnance, all which saluted the King and a vast multitude of people were spectators, supposed to be one hundred thousand at least.\nThe ships saluted the King with all their guns twice over before he came on board and once over after he came on board, and once more at the going off of the Princess Royal, the Queen of Bohemia and the Prince of Orange, which was about three of the clock in the afternoon, immediately after which the fleet set sail bound for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/646/\">Dover</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p>This day his Majesty was pleased to change the name of the Naseby into the Charles and new-named divers other ships; the Richard was named the Royal James. His Royal Highness and the Duke of York embarked in the London when we set sail, as did the Duke of Gloucester into the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/463/\">Swiftsure</a>.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Monsiour Obdam, the Hollands Admiral, came aboard the Naseby, but stayed not to go off with the Princes of Orange, and went away before dinner into another boat by himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that the King paid Mountagu a gracious compliment for his services for  \"when the long awaited moment came for the King to re-enter his kingdom, he had refused the splendid craft specially adorned for the occasion, preferring to go ashore in Mountagu's own barge\" (Ollard p.86).</p>\n\n\n<h3>II. The Bull</h3>\n\n<p>After the Restoration, Sandwich is sent to begin the arrangements for the royal wedding and secure Catherine's dowry. \"Sandwich was assigned a role part naval, part military, part diplomatic. He was to take the fleet to Lisbon to secure the very considerable cash payment which was part of the deal, go on to secure the occupation of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/\">Tangier</a> which was another part which might well be frustrated by the direct action of either the Dutch or Spaniards, and finally return to Lisbon in order to bring the new Queen of England home with him. In the interstices of this complicated mission he was to show the flag and impose, if he could, new treaties on the Barbary corsair bases of Algiers, Tripoli, Tetuan and Sallee (Ollard p.98). Ollard goes on to comment that in this entry Sandwich will reveal \"more of a talent of a fashion correspondent than of a sports reporter\" and proves  that 'he was certainly a mathematick admiral. How many observers would have counted the 74 lackeys? And he had an eye for color and texture\". Queen Catherine's Portuguese biographer, Casimiro also details the activities as translated by Pedro under the Mountagu link. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/09/30/\">September 30, 1661</a>, during this unusual break from highly stressful days full of politics, military planning and diplomacy, Sandwich captures the activities and spirit of the day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>30th. Monday. A Barnstable ship from Newfoundland came in to us once more was come in the day before. </p>\n\t\n\t<p>This day I went to Lisbon to see the Huego de Toro [editor's note: phonetic spelling of \"juego de toro\" -- a bullfight] which was in a square place before the King's palace, built on the 2 other sides with scaffolds 3 stories high hung with tapestry and carpets rich according to the quality of the noblemen and others to whom they belonged; a place railed in the middle to shelter footmen, and a tree scaffolded for trumpets. The beginning was a water cart, the men and horses and cart all trapped and covered with green tissue, came in to water the place and lay the dust. Then divers persons clad antiquely, some with guitars, other with drums and fiddles, dancing and tumbling in several sets and companies. Then there was an officer of the city mounted on a very good horse and rich saddle waited under the King's window for his commands. He was attended by several, 10 or more with pied coats and 6 green coats with sharp forks and about 6 yellow coats. The pied coats, as soon as by the King's command a bull was let out, struck him with darts and played at him to make him run at them and then escaped him by throwing off their cloaks on his horns. The men with forks likewise provoked him and when he ran at them then they exposed their forks to him at once and stopped his career. The yellow coats, when the bull was to be killed, went and seized on him, one first throwing himself between his horns and then the rest falling in and cutting his ham-strings; and then killed him. Presently whereupon there came in 6 horses all clothed and trapped with green tissue and the coachmen and postillion also and so seized a rope to the bull's horns and galloped away with him out of the quadrangle. </p>\n\t\n\t<p>After 3 or 4 bulls were tired and killed by the footmen then was another let out and the Conde de Sarzedas came in upon a fine well ranged horse very richly equipped, having 74 lackeys came in before the horse, half in red liveries with silver lace and half in green with silver lace. He marched up straight to the King's window and there went up towards it and backed his horse astern 3 times to the King of Portugal and the like to the Queen of England. Then turned to seek out the bull on a grave pace, and when he ran at him he neglectly took a lance out of his footman's hand and struck him between the horns upon the nape of his neck and broke his lance, and in like manner encountered every bull that came out, he going out 3 or 4 times to mount fresh horses very richly equipped. They killed in all 13 bulls that afternoon after one of the clock. When all was killed that ought to be, then the Conde went up again and made his respect to the King and the Queen as before and went away. Then the antiques danced again and so at sunset the company departed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h3>III. The Queen</h3>\n\n<p>Sandwich's journey to Portugal included the stressful realisation that much of Catherine's promised dowry had been used in the ongoing Portuguese war against Spain. This put Sandwich in the terrifically uncomfortable spot of having the \"decide\" if he would take Catherine with less than the promised dowry and proceed with the deal with Portugal, or abandon the wedding altogether.  The decision is made in favour of the Portuguese and the loading of the boats begins. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/03/19/\">March 19, 1662</a> Sandwich records the following.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>19th. Wednesday. In the morning we began to put sugars on board. And about noon I went to visit the Marquis of Marialva [Portugues Jew who negotiated the financial side of the marriage] and complained to him concerning the bills of exchange accounted in the schedule as part of the Queen's portion. The which I had also insisted upon with the Conde da Ponte as being clearly besides the treaty, which expresses it to be in money, jewels, sugars or other merchandises. </p>\n\t\n\t<p>This afternoon I went to wait upon the Queen of England to see whether she had any commands for me and to present the compliments of my <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/\">Lord Chancellor</a> and my <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/\">Lord Treasurer</a> unto her Majesty, which her Majesty received with very gracious expressions for them, and afterwards she told me that she did very earnestly recommend unto my care the schedule of the portion delivered me the day before by the Conde da Ponte. That her Majesty had overcome almost impossibilities to hasten her voyage and that I must put myself to mastering some difficulties also, and that I should consider the poverty of the Portugal nation caused by the oppression of their enemies.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Her Majesty also told me that it was probable that the enemies of Portugal would send a fleet to invade the river Tagus as soon as this fleet should be sailed for England, and therefore wished me to send for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/\">Sir John Lawson</a> to come to Lisbon to assist them; and assured me that both the King and the Duke of York would take it well at my hands. </p>\n\t\n\t<p>To all I returned her Majesty answer: That no person should be more careful to master all kind of difficulties in this service than myself and that I would consider what squadron of the fleet could be here soonest and accordingly wait upon her Majesty and give her Majesty further satisfaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally the day of the departure (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/04/13/\">April 13, 1662</a>) has arrived and Sandwich records the formal ceremony for Catherine to take leave of her homeland and begin the journey to England. </p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>13th. Sunday. About ten oclock in the morning I went ashore at the Terero de Paso and there was met by Don Lucas, Master of Ceremonies, and in the King's coach conducted to the Palace where I met the King, Queen of England, Q. Regent and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5041/\">Dom Pedro</a> the Infante coming out of the Presence Chamber. The Earls of Portugal walk with the King covered and in that respect the Q. of England commanded me to put on my hat, which I obeyed. The King etc went along together to the head of the stairs that descend into the court and the two Queens took leave with that decency and constancy that was admirable to see. After that the Q. of England went into her coach, next before which went the coach of respect empty, and then my coach and then the Nobles of Portugal according to their dignity. The streets of the city of Lisbon were all adorned with rich carpets and hangings at the windows and pageants made in their manner to demonstrate as much joy as could be; and the regiments of train-bands and guards that were in the city drawn out. When the Queen came to the great cathedral church, we all alighted and went before her into the church, myself placed next to Dom Pedro, the King leading the Queen of England by the hand. When we came into the church near the door, the priests brought a Cross under a rich canopy supported by 6 priests, which the K.,  Q. and D.Pd. kissed kneeling upon cushions. When they came to the Choir, the King and Queen took their seat to hear Mass and the Conde de Ponte, now Marquis de Sande, and the Visconde de ... [blank in Journal] and another Don went with me to a room purposely prepared for me to repose in until the Mass was celebrated. After Mass I came down to the Choir again and took my place before the Queen, and so we went into the coaches another way of the city to a new bridge built at the end of the King's yard purposely for the Queen to take water at, all hanged richly and floored with carpets, where the Queen descended and embarked with the King and Dom Pedro in the King's barge, and so went aboard the Royal Charles, where as soon as they were entered the Henry (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/\">Sir John Mennes</a>, Vice-Admiral) fired 61 guns, the James Rear Admiral, 59 (Capt. Clerck commander) and all the rest of the fleet proportionally. After some hours discourse the King went ashore and I by the Queen's command went along with him. The ships all fired again, the Vice Admiral 41, the Rear Admiral 39 and the rest proportionally.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>At night the ships showed out lights at every port-hole and in their tops and yards, and fired rockets and squibs, very handsome to see in the night-time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In closing, Sandwich records the wedding ceremony of Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. The significance here (spoiler) is that in the future, this actual ceremony will come into question as factions in the court of Charles II will plot to get rid of Catherine by declaring that the exchange of marriage vows did not take place.  Leaving those issues in the future, the May 21, 1662 entry reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>21st. Wednesday. In the afternoon the King and Queen came into the presence chamber upon the throne and the contract formerly made with the Portugal Ambassador was read in English by Sir John Nicholas, in Portuguese by the Portugal Secretary, de Saire; and after which the King took the Queen by the hand and (as I think) said the words of matrimony appointed in the common prayer, the Queen also declaring her consent. Then the Bishop of London stood forth and made the declaration of matrimony in the common prayer and did pronounce them man and wife in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>The above entries are among the most \"animated\" of those found in Sandwich's Journal prior to 1663, yet give a glimpse into his eye for detail, appreciation of ceremony and different cultural experiences (which will serve him well in his future). The majority of the Journal tracks naval issues and activities of the ships while at sea. There is included a sketch in his hand of the Disposition of the English fleet off Algiers.  Unlike Sam, Sandwich's entries reveal very little of the personal side of his life. The Journal for 1662 ends a week later with the State reception of the King and Queen at Hampton Court. There are no entries for 1663 and the Journal takes up again in 1664.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Books consulted and/or quoted</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Anderson, R. C.

            "text_html": "<p>Pepys writes \"My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world, that could give an offence to any, and with the great honour he thought it would be to him.\" As the annotators went about their discussion of the entry, one notation in particular provided a most thoughtful glimpse into the question of the more personal side of Lord Sandwich. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/05/25/#5028\">Mary wrote</a>,  \"This is the first truly personal glimpse that we have had of Mountagu, whose presentation is normally very deferential and leads the reader to assume that he is much older and more 'mature' than Sam. It reminds us that there is very little age difference between Sam and his master; there is a matter of only 7 or 8 years between them.\"</p>\n\n<p>While Sam's diary captures a uniquely diverse and expansive view of 17th century life, Claire Tomalin's biography of Pepys explains that Sandwich's journals \"were largely official and impersonal and altogether different from what Pepys\" wrote in his diary. (p.81). She further explains that as a \"high official serving the state, [he] had good reason to keep records of ... [his] ... meetings and travel\" (p.78)  and the style of his affords more of a formal approach in the manner of his writing.</p>\n\n<p>R. C. Anderson, who edited the <cite>Journals of the Earl of Sandwich</cite> (herein the Journal)  covering the period of 1659-1665, tells us that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>All of his Journal that relates to his activities as a naval commander is contained in a single volume, which covers the period 12th March 1658/9 to 13th September 1665, when he returned to the Nore from the final short, but successful, cruise of that year in the North Sea. His journal as second in command of the fleet in 1672 probably perished with him in the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3124/\">Royal James</a>; at any rate, it is not preserved at Hinchingbrooke with the rest of his papers.</p>\n\n    <p>During the years 1659-1665 his work afloat was varied and important; including, as it did, the expedition to the Sound, the Restoration, the operations against Algiers, the acquisition of Tangier, the home-coming of the new Queen, [historical spoilers follow] the mobilisation of 1664, the battle of Lowestoft, the failure at Bergen, and the capture of the Dutch East-Indiamen in 1665. The list is a long one, covering nearly the whole of the more important work of the Navy for those years, and in every case save one Sandwich was the leading figure.</p>\n\n    <p>For the most part his journal is in his own writing. Even where this is not the case, notably in the first section relating to the voyage to Denmark, there are frequent additions and corrections by his own hand.  One of the most noticeable things about it is the evidence that he took far more interest in the purely nautical side of his profession than one would expect of a young 'gentleman admiral'.....  [and] there is abundance of evidence that Sandwich did his own navigation while at sea and spent a great deal of time in harbour in surveying work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(pp. ix-x)</p>\n\n<p>Anderson also points out that that what is missing (which is found in abundance in Sam's diary) is anything \"of a personal nature.\" A case in point is that the Index to the <cite>Journal</cite> contains 10 pages of named ships and only 8 rather minor references to Sam.  Sandwich's journal and his personal life were two separate entities and rarely did his journal provide insight into him as 'a person'. That being said, perhaps a few entries prior to 1663, capture a glimpse of his sense of excitement, wonder and interest in the world around him. The three Journal sections below include the Restoration of Charles II, the preparations of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a> for her trip to England, and a bullfight that perhaps comes the \"closest\" in writing style to any of Sam's diary entries. A short introduction will be given to each to putting entry into perspective followed by the entry in Sandwich's own words.</p>\n\n<h3>I. The King</h3>\n\n<p>For the final stages of the Restoration, Mountagu (not yet Lord Sandwich) returned from his 'retirement' at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/\">Hinchingbrooke</a> and was reappointed General of the fleet together with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/\">Monk</a>. While Monk maintained order ashore, Mountagu embarked to prepare the fleet for its coming duty of bringing back the King.  Although Mountagu is making history with this voyage, his entries records the details of the day without any indication of crediting himself for pulling this off. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/05/23/\">May 23 1660</a>, the King finally set foot upon Mountagu's ship the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/462/\">Naseby</a>. The entry reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>23rd. Wednesday. In the morning the General went in his barge close to the shore-side at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/824/\">Schevelinge</a>, where was prepared a Dutch vessel to carry His Majesty on board the Naseby, and about ten of the clock in the morning the King's most sacred Majesty came to the shore-side and boarded the said vessel, but before she was launched from the shore his Majesty went off her into the Rear Admiral's boat and came presently on board the General's barge, as did also the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/\">Dukes of York</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/829/\">Gloucester</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/803/\">Princess Royal</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/833/\">Queen of Bohemia</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/\">Prince of Orange</a>, and so were rowed from the Naseby, which ship they boarded about eleven of the clock in the morning.\n    </p>\n    <p>There were upon the shore at Schevelinge many troops of horse and foot of the States, and about forty pieces of ordnance, all which saluted the King and a vast multitude of people were spectators, supposed to be one hundred thousand at least.\nThe ships saluted the King with all their guns twice over before he came on board and once over after he came on board, and once more at the going off of the Princess Royal, the Queen of Bohemia and the Prince of Orange, which was about three of the clock in the afternoon, immediately after which the fleet set sail bound for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/646/\">Dover</a>.</p>\n\n    <p>This day his Majesty was pleased to change the name of the Naseby into the Charles and new-named divers other ships; the Richard was named the Royal James. His Royal Highness and the Duke of York embarked in the London when we set sail, as did the Duke of Gloucester into the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/463/\">Swiftsure</a>.</p>\n\n    <p>Monsiour Obdam, the Hollands Admiral, came aboard the Naseby, but stayed not to go off with the Princes of Orange, and went away before dinner into another boat by himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that the King paid Mountagu a gracious compliment for his services for  \"when the long awaited moment came for the King to re-enter his kingdom, he had refused the splendid craft specially adorned for the occasion, preferring to go ashore in Mountagu's own barge\" (Ollard p.86).</p>\n\n<h3>II. The Bull</h3>\n\n<p>After the Restoration, Sandwich is sent to begin the arrangements for the royal wedding and secure Catherine's dowry. \"Sandwich was assigned a role part naval, part military, part diplomatic. He was to take the fleet to Lisbon to secure the very considerable cash payment which was part of the deal, go on to secure the occupation of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/\">Tangier</a> which was another part which might well be frustrated by the direct action of either the Dutch or Spaniards, and finally return to Lisbon in order to bring the new Queen of England home with him. In the interstices of this complicated mission he was to show the flag and impose, if he could, new treaties on the Barbary corsair bases of Algiers, Tripoli, Tetuan and Sallee (Ollard p.98). Ollard goes on to comment that in this entry Sandwich will reveal \"more of a talent of a fashion correspondent than of a sports reporter\" and proves  that 'he was certainly a mathematick admiral. How many observers would have counted the 74 lackeys? And he had an eye for color and texture\". Queen Catherine's Portuguese biographer, Casimiro also details the activities as translated by Pedro under the Mountagu link. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1661/09/30/\">September 30, 1661</a>, during this unusual break from highly stressful days full of politics, military planning and diplomacy, Sandwich captures the activities and spirit of the day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>30th. Monday. A Barnstable ship from Newfoundland came in to us once more was come in the day before. </p>\n\n    <p>This day I went to Lisbon to see the Huego de Toro [editor's note: phonetic spelling of \"juego de toro\" -- a bullfight] which was in a square place before the King's palace, built on the 2 other sides with scaffolds 3 stories high hung with tapestry and carpets rich according to the quality of the noblemen and others to whom they belonged; a place railed in the middle to shelter footmen, and a tree scaffolded for trumpets. The beginning was a water cart, the men and horses and cart all trapped and covered with green tissue, came in to water the place and lay the dust. Then divers persons clad antiquely, some with guitars, other with drums and fiddles, dancing and tumbling in several sets and companies. Then there was an officer of the city mounted on a very good horse and rich saddle waited under the King's window for his commands. He was attended by several, 10 or more with pied coats and 6 green coats with sharp forks and about 6 yellow coats. The pied coats, as soon as by the King's command a bull was let out, struck him with darts and played at him to make him run at them and then escaped him by throwing off their cloaks on his horns. The men with forks likewise provoked him and when he ran at them then they exposed their forks to him at once and stopped his career. The yellow coats, when the bull was to be killed, went and seized on him, one first throwing himself between his horns and then the rest falling in and cutting his ham-strings; and then killed him. Presently whereupon there came in 6 horses all clothed and trapped with green tissue and the coachmen and postillion also and so seized a rope to the bull's horns and galloped away with him out of the quadrangle. </p>\n\n    <p>After 3 or 4 bulls were tired and killed by the footmen then was another let out and the Conde de Sarzedas came in upon a fine well ranged horse very richly equipped, having 74 lackeys came in before the horse, half in red liveries with silver lace and half in green with silver lace. He marched up straight to the King's window and there went up towards it and backed his horse astern 3 times to the King of Portugal and the like to the Queen of England. Then turned to seek out the bull on a grave pace, and when he ran at him he neglectly took a lance out of his footman's hand and struck him between the horns upon the nape of his neck and broke his lance, and in like manner encountered every bull that came out, he going out 3 or 4 times to mount fresh horses very richly equipped. They killed in all 13 bulls that afternoon after one of the clock. When all was killed that ought to be, then the Conde went up again and made his respect to the King and the Queen as before and went away. Then the antiques danced again and so at sunset the company departed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>III. The Queen</h3>\n\n<p>Sandwich's journey to Portugal included the stressful realisation that much of Catherine's promised dowry had been used in the ongoing Portuguese war against Spain. This put Sandwich in the terrifically uncomfortable spot of having the \"decide\" if he would take Catherine with less than the promised dowry and proceed with the deal with Portugal, or abandon the wedding altogether.  The decision is made in favour of the Portuguese and the loading of the boats begins. On <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/03/19/\">March 19, 1662</a> Sandwich records the following.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>19th. Wednesday. In the morning we began to put sugars on board. And about noon I went to visit the Marquis of Marialva [Portugues Jew who negotiated the financial side of the marriage] and complained to him concerning the bills of exchange accounted in the schedule as part of the Queen's portion. The which I had also insisted upon with the Conde da Ponte as being clearly besides the treaty, which expresses it to be in money, jewels, sugars or other merchandises. </p>\n\n    <p>This afternoon I went to wait upon the Queen of England to see whether she had any commands for me and to present the compliments of my <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/\">Lord Chancellor</a> and my <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/\">Lord Treasurer</a> unto her Majesty, which her Majesty received with very gracious expressions for them, and afterwards she told me that she did very earnestly recommend unto my care the schedule of the portion delivered me the day before by the Conde da Ponte. That her Majesty had overcome almost impossibilities to hasten her voyage and that I must put myself to mastering some difficulties also, and that I should consider the poverty of the Portugal nation caused by the oppression of their enemies.</p>\n\n    <p>Her Majesty also told me that it was probable that the enemies of Portugal would send a fleet to invade the river Tagus as soon as this fleet should be sailed for England, and therefore wished me to send for <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/\">Sir John Lawson</a> to come to Lisbon to assist them; and assured me that both the King and the Duke of York would take it well at my hands. </p>\n\n    <p>To all I returned her Majesty answer: That no person should be more careful to master all kind of difficulties in this service than myself and that I would consider what squadron of the fleet could be here soonest and accordingly wait upon her Majesty and give her Majesty further satisfaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally the day of the departure (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/04/13/\">April 13, 1662</a>) has arrived and Sandwich records the formal ceremony for Catherine to take leave of her homeland and begin the journey to England. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>13th. Sunday. About ten oclock in the morning I went ashore at the Terero de Paso and there was met by Don Lucas, Master of Ceremonies, and in the King's coach conducted to the Palace where I met the King, Queen of England, Q.

            "title": "A Walk with Ferrers", 
            "text": "<h3>I</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The \"Mock Marriage\" of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/\">Lady Castlemaine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/\">Mrs. Stuart</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>On January 4th 1662, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1272/\">Princess Henrietta</a> (Minette) sent her brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">King Charles</a> a letter from France which read, \"I would not miss the opportunity of writing to you but by Madam Stuart who is taking her daughter to be one of the maids of the queen, your wife. Had it not been for this purpose I assure you I should have been very sorry to let her go from here, for she is the prettiest girl imaginable and the most fitted to adorn a court.\"   Thus enters Frances Teresa Stuart. </p>\n\n<p>Some historians believe that perhaps Minette wasn't too pleased with Lady Castlemaine's influence over Charles and thought that it might be wise to introduce a Catholic, with a French upbringing as a potential mistress. Frances had been raised in the Queen Mother's exiled court in France and Henrietta Marie felt very protective of her. Her tremendous beauty, in spite of her young age (14 at the time of the letter) made a stunning impact on the English Court, especially the King. Historians/biographers will record that she had a very na\u00efve manner, a beautiful figure and a freshness that set her apart from the other court ladies. She was a divine dancer, loved attention and laughed at Charles' repetitive stories and jokes. She was \"bubbly\", flirty, charming and interested in light-hearted games of making card houses, blind-man's bluff and more \"childish\" interactions. Frances had an ample dose of vanity (most likely tied to immaturity as time will reveal) but a total lack of interest in politics, courtly ambition and/or greed, all of which combined to appeal quite strongly the King.</p>\n\n<p>Lady Castlemaine, well known for her arrogance, never initially dreamed that any such \"young silly thing\" could be a match for her charms and encouraged the friendship between Frances and Charles. She treated Frances like a little ornament, inviting her to court games and entertainment. At times she invited Frances to sleep in her bed and then would invite Charles in to join them for playful little three in the bed antics. Frances would not allow for these games to proceed far enough to take away her virginity. Castlemaine may have thought it a calculated game to toy with the King's roving eye, assuming Charles would soon get his fill when Frances succumbed (as he had done with other maids of honor in the past) and that soon the infatuation would pass. Needless to say, the Lady who had made herself infamous for manipulations and calculations had underestimated the King's growing desire for Frances. </p>\n\n<p>The story that Ferrers told Sam on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/30/\">February 8, 1663</a> is one of the many little entertainments instigated by Castlemaine, which were not unusual activities in Court life.  In this case, Castlemaine staged this marital charade and took the role of the groom. As the play progressed and it was time to \"bed\" the little bride, Charles stepped in to take Castlemaine's place. As other historians will note, which differs somewhat from Sam's version, the little prey Frances, balked and the charade came to an end. She was not actually bedded by the King.  Shortly after this episode, Castlemaine begins to get wind of the more serious interest Charles has developed and takes \"alarm now and [will not be] such a fool as to bring down the very thing that would compass her own downfall\". (Hartmann p. 36). </p>\n\n<p>Amidst all of these antics and seeming frivolous Court activities, there were maneuvers of a different kind afloat already. Others who had noticed the King's wandering eyes were seeking to use this to their advantage.  The <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/\">Duke of Buckingham</a> and some assorted followers of the King had formed a committee behind Castlemaine's back to \"pimp\" the young, unsuspecting girl into the arms of the King. This pimping was a common practice among Charles' close Court circle. Halifax, an observant contemporary and minister of the King who had long observed his manner, explains in his \"Character of King Charles II\" that \"After he was restored, mistresses were recommended to him; which is no small matter in a Court, and not unworthy the thoughts even of a party. A mistress either dexterous in herself, or well-instructed by those that are so, may be very useful to her friends, not only in the immediate hours of her ministry, but by her influences and insinuations at other times. It was resolved generally by others, whom he should have in his arms, as well as whom he should have in his councils. Of a man who was so capable of choosing, he chose as seldom as any man that ever lived....\"  and \"He lived with his ministers as he did with his mistresses; he used them , but he was not in love with them\". (Halifax, pps.28-29/39).</p>\n\n<p>As we watch this develop over time through Sam's diary entries, the pimping committee will assemble and develop their plans to entice and/or trick Frances into the role of mistress. Of note to the readers, it will be most interesting to watch exactly who gets drawn into the planning. The participants in these efforts may be surprising to some, as they may not be people one would normally associate with this type of seemingly immoral activity. It should be noted that throughout Charles' reign, many seasoned courtiers, ministers, ambassadors, etc., even those from the old school of the strict  moral conduct of Charles I, were drawn into the link between politics, money and sex. This was almost a \"required\" means to ensure that their international/political/personal needs and/or ambitions were met. Case in point, even the dignified and morally principled Ormond (Clarendon's best friend from the 'old school') was a realist enough to \"know that when it came to payments to be made out of Irish revenues he made sure that Barbara [Castlemaine, and other mistresses de jour] ... ..came up well in the pecking order\". (Wilson, p. 295). These types of pay-offs, political alliances and feeding of funds were quite common.  Those seasoned political courtiers/ministers who were \"in it for the long haul\" knew that when building their  alliances they had to consider  the influence of mistresses as they played such a central part of Charles' Court life and personal inclinations. Although historians will debate the actual influence that these ladies had in his lifetime, what is clear is that among the Court, the perception of their power was strong and perception meant everything in the world of Court politics. </p>\n\n<p>If any one potential candidate for mistress broke through the 'mistress model' set forth by Halifax above, and excited Charles' actual inclinations to \"fall in love\" it was Frances Stuart.  The light hearted writers of the day (Grammont), and the more serious diarists like Sam recorded details of the antics, gossip and \"cat fights\" as these ladies interacted. Much was made of the \"pawning\" of Frances Stuart, and the long line of other ladies that fluttered in and out of this Court.   Behind these anecdotes, no matter how seedy, frivolous and/ or sensationalized there was usually some level of personal/political underlying maneuvering which was targeted at the securing of these ladies for the King. In the meantime and on a much more frivolous note, it will also be \"fun\" to see these events unfold through Sam's eyes. </p>\n\n<h3>II</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The Titling of Monmouth</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The little <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5315/\">Duke of Monmouth</a>, it seems, is ordered to take the place of all Dukes, and so to follow <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/\">Prince Rupert</a> now, before the Duke of Buckingham, or any else.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Charles decided to grant James Crofts, his illegitimate son by Lucy Waters, a peerage with the designation of Duke of Monmouth. The titling of Monmouth and placement in the peerage rank of the Dukes was not something to be taken lightly and inferred many levels of political implications, anxiety among legitimate parties of nobility, as well as adding fuel to the fired frenzy of court gossip. </p>\n\n<p>Hutton, Charles' biographer believed this status elevation was more politically motivated than anything else and states that, \"It was a political move, for mere affection would have impelled Charles to keep the boy near him in a less illustrious capacity. In default of any evidence, one can only ascribe it to a desire to parade his potency before the world or (more likely) to a hazy design to secure the Stuart succession in the event of the death of his brother. The second supposition is supported by a search which the King launched in the winter of 1662-1663 to find a precedent in Scottish history (English tradition being hostile) for a monarch legitimizing his bastard son. There was no suggestion that he was contemplating the exclusion of his brother from the succession and the object seemed to be to secure young James [Crofts] princely dignities and some eventual claim to the throne... If nothing else, this attempt suggests powerfully that Charles had not married Lucy [Walters--Monmouth's mother, a rumor that will play out throughout his reign] and so did not have the means of establishing his son for use in emergency. \"  (p 188). Although Scottish royalty did not provide the much desired protocol which Charles desired, he continued to load his son with honors, but not without bringing forth some discord in the process.  </p>\n\n<p>Those most openly irritated by this granting of honors to Charles' bastard were his brother James, his mother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/\">Henrietta Maria</a>, Lady Castlemaine (the grants to Monmouth gave him a higher status then her children by Charles) and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/\">Clarendon</a> (James' father-in-law), but the individual most hurt by these events was Charles' wife, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine</a>. Her despair is recorded in this letter from the Duke of York to his father-in-law the Lord Chancellor, Clarendon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Thursday morning</em><br />\nMy brother hath spoken with the Queen yesterday concerning the owning of his sonne, and in much passion she told him that from the time he did any such thing she would never see his face more. I would be glad to see you before you go to the Parliament that I may advise with you what is to be done, for my brother tells me he will do whatever I please.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Davidson, p 165)</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the Queen, the granting of this title to James Crofts was a blatant insult. Davidson explains that \"to create the son of another woman a Duke of the Royal House was an outrage on herself and any future children she may have.  Charles, only bent on reparation to women whom, like Lady Castlemaine, he had injured in reputation, and to their children, was determined to openly acknowledge his son, and load him with honors. He was always extremely fond of his left-handed children, and it gave him pleasure to shower favors on them. In spite of Catherine's declaration that she would see his face no more, the patent was granted, and throughout his life Catherine treated the Duke of Monmouth, as she treated all the rest of Charles's children, with sweet and unvarying kindness. He was granted precedence over every other Duke in the Realm, except the Duke of York, and loaded with such distinctions and favor that people whispered he was Charles's lawful son, and would be his successor\".  (Davidson, p. 165). It should be noted, as Fraser points out that when James was actually created Duke of Monmouth that the \"baton sinister, which proclaimed his illegitimate birth, [was] omitted from his coat of arms [and] Catherine felt it necessary to protest. A second grant of arms included it\". (Fraser, p. 275)</p>\n\n<p>Although the fact that the York-Hyde letter infers that Charles will \"do whatever I please\", the outcome may not have truly reflected James' wishes.  \"In his own self-defense the Duke of York asked his brother the King for security that the young lad would not eventually hopscotch over him in precedence to become heir to the throne if the Queen failed to bear children - an assurance which for long the King would not specifically give. The only immediate reaction which the Duke could control was to engender another child [his wife was pregnant and a short lived son James was born July 12, 1663] at which, within wedlock, he was more adept than the King\". ( Allen p 75-76). </p>\n\n<p>On a broader scale Sir Henry Craik, Clarendon's biographer explains that the moral sense of the nation was already starting to disintegrate and that these domestic scandals of the Court had begun to \"outrage the nations's sense of decency; and when outraged decency is combined with increased pressure on taxation and decreasing prosperity the united force becomes a menacing threat. It was a comparative trifle that the King's alleged bastard by the notorious Lucy Waters, was now favorably introduced at Court... and speedily created Duke of Monmouth.   Such relationships had before been tacitly recognized but not explicitly avowed; now for the first time the patent of nobility declared the youth to be the natural son of the King. Vice laid aside that homage of hypocrisy which it had before paid to virtue. It was an innovation which Clarendon firmly opposed. \"It would have\" he told the King quite plainly, \"an ill sound in England with all his people, who thought that these unlawful acts ought to be concealed, and not published and justified.\"  Precedents from France and Spain would not pass current in England; and even if these precedents were admitted, they would hardly parallel the ennobling of the bastard of a notorious courtesan, born when the King was scarcely sixteen years of age, and whose parentage was, to say the least, doubtful.\" (Craik, p. 171)  Although these domestic scandals may seem to amount to little, when taken in the context of  growing discontent and the  declining English market  now was not the time to add to the  decaying reverence to the crown, but, Charles, as always, acted on his own.    </p>\n\n<p>Without the King giving a firm statement regarding his succession plans and in light of the gnawing away at the status of the monarchy, rippling effects of uneasiness continued. There were on-going themes of conflict, upheavals and drama over the course of Charles' reign regarding the future monarchy, which Charles chose not to address until his later years, thus feeding into a somewhat unsettling atmosphere. Halifax, who well noted Charles as one who could not always be trusted at his word, noted that \"Dissimulation is like most other Qualities, it hath two Sides; it is necessary, and yet it is dangerous too\".  As Charles will be a master of Dissimulation throughout his life, only he will ever know the motives, purposes and objectives of this titling, and unfortunately he will bear the brunt of his decision in his lifetime. But for February 8, 1663 and in years to come these issues will leave the Court much to discuss and offer our Sam bountiful tidbits to record. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Books consulted and/or quoted</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrews, Allen: <cite>The Royal Whore</cite>, 1970</li>\n<li>Clarendon, Earl of (Edward Hyde): <cite>The Life of Edward Earl of Claredon, Lord High Chancellor of England and Chancellor of the University of Oxford Containing An Account of His Life from his birth to the Restoration in 1660</cite>, 1761. </li>\n<li>Craik, Sir Henry: <cite>The Life of Edward Earl of Clarendon, Lord High Chancellor of England</cite>, 1911</li>\n<li>Davidson, Lillias Campbell: <cite>Catherine of Braganca</cite>, 1908. </li>\n<li>Fraser, Antonia: <cite>King Charles II</cite>, 1979</li>\n<li>Hartmann, Cyril: <cite>La Belle Stuart</cite>,  1924</li>\n<li>Hutton, Ronald: <cite>Charles II</cite>, 1989. </li>\n<li>Ollard, Richard: <cite>Clarendon and His Friends</cite>, 1988. </li>\n<li>Ponsoby, Dorothy: <cite>The King's Ladies</cite>, 1936. </li>\n<li>Savile, George Marquis of Halifax: <cite>Character of K.

            "text_html": "<h3>I</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The \"Mock Marriage\" of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/\">Lady Castlemaine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/\">Mrs. Stuart</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>On January 4th 1662, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1272/\">Princess Henrietta</a> (Minette) sent her brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/\">King Charles</a> a letter from France which read, \"I would not miss the opportunity of writing to you but by Madam Stuart who is taking her daughter to be one of the maids of the queen, your wife. Had it not been for this purpose I assure you I should have been very sorry to let her go from here, for she is the prettiest girl imaginable and the most fitted to adorn a court.\"   Thus enters Frances Teresa Stuart. </p>\n\n<p>Some historians believe that perhaps Minette wasn't too pleased with Lady Castlemaine's influence over Charles and thought that it might be wise to introduce a Catholic, with a French upbringing as a potential mistress. Frances had been raised in the Queen Mother's exiled court in France and Henrietta Marie felt very protective of her. Her tremendous beauty, in spite of her young age (14 at the time of the letter) made a stunning impact on the English Court, especially the King. Historians/biographers will record that she had a very na\u00efve manner, a beautiful figure and a freshness that set her apart from the other court ladies. She was a divine dancer, loved attention and laughed at Charles' repetitive stories and jokes. She was \"bubbly\", flirty, charming and interested in light-hearted games of making card houses, blind-man's bluff and more \"childish\" interactions. Frances had an ample dose of vanity (most likely tied to immaturity as time will reveal) but a total lack of interest in politics, courtly ambition and/or greed, all of which combined to appeal quite strongly the King.</p>\n\n<p>Lady Castlemaine, well known for her arrogance, never initially dreamed that any such \"young silly thing\" could be a match for her charms and encouraged the friendship between Frances and Charles. She treated Frances like a little ornament, inviting her to court games and entertainment. At times she invited Frances to sleep in her bed and then would invite Charles in to join them for playful little three in the bed antics. Frances would not allow for these games to proceed far enough to take away her virginity. Castlemaine may have thought it a calculated game to toy with the King's roving eye, assuming Charles would soon get his fill when Frances succumbed (as he had done with other maids of honor in the past) and that soon the infatuation would pass. Needless to say, the Lady who had made herself infamous for manipulations and calculations had underestimated the King's growing desire for Frances. </p>\n\n<p>The story that Ferrers told Sam on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/01/30/\">February 8, 1663</a> is one of the many little entertainments instigated by Castlemaine, which were not unusual activities in Court life.  In this case, Castlemaine staged this marital charade and took the role of the groom. As the play progressed and it was time to \"bed\" the little bride, Charles stepped in to take Castlemaine's place. As other historians will note, which differs somewhat from Sam's version, the little prey Frances, balked and the charade came to an end. She was not actually bedded by the King.  Shortly after this episode, Castlemaine begins to get wind of the more serious interest Charles has developed and takes \"alarm now and [will not be] such a fool as to bring down the very thing that would compass her own downfall\".

It has been the parish church of the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/\">House of Commons</a> since 1614<sup>2</sup>. Founded in 11th or 12th century, it was rebuilt in 1504-23.

Charles' historians and biographers (Clarendon, Bryant, Hutton, Faulkus, Fraser, Coote, Ollard, Wilson, Ponsonby) and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine's</a> biographers (Strickland, Davidson, Mackay, Sousa, Rau, Casimiro, etc.), all differ somewhat in dates, details, descriptions and interpretations of the events, but most agree that the damage done here set a horrible precedent within the Royal marriage, the ministry, the court, the treasury, and even international relations. This entry is only intended as a general summary of some complex and detailed events so please forgive any deletions, inaccuracies, etc. and consider this for the more \"generalists\" among the background readers, as opposed to those who strive for exactness.  Some slight spoilers may be here but I've tried best to keep to the \"behind the scenes\" view that Sam did not see. </p>", 
            "title": "The Bedchamber", 
            "text": "<p>Charles had married Catherine viewing the marriage as a state affair. In her naivety she may not have understood this and genuinely seems to have mistaken the attention given her by her husband during her honeymoon period to be real and sincere. With a total lack of experience in these matters, a devout belief in her marital vows and religion during their time at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1765/\">Hampton Court</a> she truly fell in love with her husband.  What she did not see was that in the background, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/\">Lady Castlemaine</a>, who was the king's mistress had delivered a child and demanded Charles not only to claim it as his own but to repay her for her \"services\" to him by establishing her as his \"maitresse en title\". Through whatever means Castlemaine customarily used; rage filled outbursts, screaming, threats, tears, etc., she wore on Charles and he agreed to place her on the Queen's list as a Lady of the Bedchamber. This assigned role would imply that Castelmaine would have free access to attend to the Queen, follow her through her daily religious, public and personal routines and, through her presence, torment her by flaunting her public position as the King's lover.  The insult to the Queen was enormous and reflected an incredibly insensitive disregard to her feelings and position, not only as a human being, but also as a wife and hopefully, perhaps one day mother of a royal child.  Nowhere is it stated or believed by any historian (or even Charles, for that matter) that \"love\" had anything to do with Castlemaine's manoeuvres as money, greed, power, arrogance, vanity and position were her well known motives. She historically would and did use sex, blackmail, belittling or whatever extreme available to her to get what she wanted. Charles thought it easiest to succumb to Castlemaine's tantrums thinking that his \"docile\" little wife would accept his request due to her ignorance to the situation and her accommodating sweetness. Charles knew that Catherine was in love with him, so he assumed it would be easy to just slip Castlemaine onto the list and be done with it. If he was lucky, Catherine wouldn't even know she was being insulted.  He wasn't lucky. The one thing that Charles didn't know was that Catherine's mother had warned Catherine to \"never let Lady Castlemaine in your presence\". </p>\n\n<p>As Sam reports on this day, Catherine obliterated Lady Castlemaine's name from the list and returned it. What he won't see is that this humiliating, heartbreaking and personal insult to Catherine is followed by a series of confrontations and manoeuvres by Charles intended to force her to succumb to his command to accept Castlemaine.  As the conflict escalated Charles' court friends  \"used ever after all the ill Arts they could to make it disagreeable, and to alienate the King's Affections from the Queen to such a degree, that it might never be in her Power to prevail with him to their Disadvantage\". (Clarendon p. 317). After a period of lulling where Charles promised Catherine he would not push his request, he deceived her by bringing forth Castlemaine to publicly present her to the Queen at a court event. Catherine, not knowing who this woman even was, unknowingly acknowledged her. An attendant told her that this was Castlemaine.  Catherine, taken totally off guard, burst into tears, her nose began to bleed; she fainted away and had to be carried out of the room. Charles stayed behind thus publicly siding with Castlemaine. </p>\n\n<p>As the  tension intensified, Charles went to reprimand Catherine himself with the result being that  \"the passion and noise of the night reached too many ears to be a secret the next day; and the whole Court was full of that, which ought to have been known to nobody \" (Clarendon p. 334). Catherine demanded her return to Portugal if she could not be treated with the respect of a wife and be allowed to have control of her own household. Although the return home was a na&iuml;ve request on her part which would cause repercussions in international diplomacy if entertained, the painfulness of Catherine's statement was a huge blow to Charles' ego and hurt him terribly. No woman had ever even considered walking away from him before. He retaliated by telling her to be sure that they even wanted her in Portugal as they had sent her without the contracted dowry and hadn't delivered on the money as promised (something which most historians believe that Catherine had no previous knowledge of). She was devastated, embarrassed for her country and national pride. Charles was now adamant, Catherine was not only to accept Castlemaine to her bedchamber, but also acknowledge her socially in public.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next weeks, \"Charles applied crueler and cruder pressure\" (Hutton, p 187) and Davidson reports that Charles sent almost all of Catherine's Portuguese attendants back to Portugal, he threw Diego Silvas (the Portuguese Jew who accompanied her and was responsible for paying the dowry) into jail even though the payment was not yet due. He was rude to the Portuguese <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2752/\">Ambassador De Sande</a> (Catherine's godfather). He publicly ignored her and paraded Lady Castlemaine around, flaunting her, flirting with her and showering her with affection while he made sure that his wife was abandoned. Clarendon reports that \"His Majesty was in continual conference with her [Castlemaine] whilst the Queen sat untaken notice of; and if her Majesty rose at the indignity and retired into her chamber, it may be one or two attended her; but all the company remained in the room she had left, and too often said those things which nobody ought to have whispered. She alone was left out of all jollities, and not suffered to have any part in those pleasant applications and caresses that she saw made abroad to everybody else; a universal mirth in all company but hers, and in all place but in her chamber, her own servants showing more respect and more diligence to the person of the Lady [Castlemaine] than towards their own mistress, who, they found, could do them no good\" (Clarendon,p. 341). Nobody dared publicly side with the Queen for fear of Charles' rage. Castlemaine's court friends urged Charles to stand firm.</p>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, Charles dumped the dirty work on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/\">Clarendon</a> and told him to make his wife succumb or else. Clarendon, who morally sided with the Queen and passionately hated Castlemaine, was stuck in the position of asking Catherine to succumb to his King's request. \"Clarendon saw the manners and morals of the educated world into which he had been born the real object of the Restoration\" (Ollard,p. 135) and Castlemaine, a vulgar mannered, arrogant whore when at her best, was the enemy to all of those things that Clarendon sought to restore. Clarendon did confront Charles on his actions but as a result of his questioning of the King he received the following letter of scathing rebuke:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...And I wish I may be unhappy in this world and all the world to come if I fail in the least degree of which I an resolved, which is of making my Lady Castlemaine of my wife's bedchamber, and whosoever I find use any endeavor to hinder this resolution of mine (except it be only to myself) I will be his enemy to the last moment of my life. You know how true a friend I have been to you. If you will oblige me eternally, make this business as easy as you can, of what opinion soever you are. For I am resolved to go through with this matter, let what you will come of it, which I solomnly swear before Almighty God. Therefore if you desire to have continuance of my friendship, meddle no more in my business, except it be to bear down all false, scandalous reports and to facilitate what I am sure my honour is so much concerned in. And whosoever I find be to be my Lady Castlemaine's enemy in this matter, I do promise upon my word to be his enemy as long as I live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Wilson p. 168). Clarendon lost his spine and tried to persuade Catherine to succumb as he'd been ordered to. </p>\n\n<p>In a letter from France dated 22 July 1662, Charles' most beloved sister <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1272/\">Henrietta</a> wrote to him shocked at his behavior and defending the Queen. \"You tell me that someone has spoken ill of a certain person, to the Queen your wife. Alas, is it possible that such things are really said? I who know your innocence can only wonder! But to speak seriously, I beg you to tell me how the Queen has taken this. Here people say that she is in deepest distress and to speak frankly I think she has only to good reason for her grief\" (Wilson, p. 168). It all fell on deaf ears. </p>\n\n<p>On another front, Portugal was facing difficulties. They needed the arrival of the English troops as promised in the marriage contract. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5039/\">Queen Luisa</a> was facing the overthrow of her reign and a takeover by a section of the government led by Castel Melhor (under the guise of her unfit son <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5040/\">Alfonso</a>, who would then easily be pushed aside, due to his lack of competence). The dowry was still unpaid without hopes to raise the money. The potential crisis in her homeland, the return of her entourage to Portugal and her concerns for her family weighed heavily on Catherine. She may have come to England with a young girl's hopeful heart, betting on her future as wife to a legend of a husband and open to her first experience with love, but the essence of her person, her worth and identity were and always would be first with Portugal and the duty she carried with her to support her nation. </p>\n\n<p>\"Over the next few weeks the king's attitude hardened towards the queen and those who took her part with severity and even uncharacteristic cruelty. He had boxed himself into a corner and had done so publicly. He could not yield without losing face and authority. The more he was accused by people he loved and respected (and probably his own conscious) of being unkind and unreasonable, the more steadfastly he stuck to his guns\" (Wilson, p. 165). Charles took the position that to waiver from his request would imply that he was ruled by his wife, which would be an insult to his honor. \"Here we have Charles in his most contradictory aspect. He prated of his honor, the while he insisted on forcing upon the woman who by all moral and spiritual laws had the highest claim to his consideration, the companionship of one whom he should have been ashamed to mention in Catherine's presence\" (Ponsoby, p 114). \"Beneath her canopy of cloth of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              supported on pillars wreathed with flowers, the frightened, isolated Catherine was reaching her breaking point\". (Hutton, p188).\" </p>\n\n<p>As the weeks dragged on, and Queen Henrietta's visit loomed ahead, Charles' despicable treatment of Catherine bore down harder and \"succeeded\". Catherine, humiliated, separated from her Portuguese entourage, fearful of the welfare of her family and homeland, lacking the language skills to communicate with others in her now home was all alone. She had quietly moved through the painful process of accepting that the love she had brought with her was not reciprocated and began to understand that the frivolities of a debauched, vain and licentious  court were of more importance to her husband then was she.</p> \n\n<p>Without any delusions left, all hopes gone, she succumbed. The results were disastrous. Whatever \"secret respect\" the historians' claim that Charles had for her was gone. Once Catherine accepted her rival into her entourage, she \"merely added contempt to her husband's hostile feeling towards her\" (Hutton, p. 188).  He angrily escalated his public affair with Castlemaine.  Most English historians imply that there was no \"real reason\" for the change in Catherine's position and several reflect it as a criticism of her as a weak person. All agree it was the defining point in their marriage that ended any possibility of a loving relation between the couple, on the part of Charles. The Portuguese historians (Rau, Casimiro) are clear that Portugal had an immediate need for military support at this time. Their perspective explains that given her love of her homeland and Portugal's desperate need for England's assistance in their war against Spain, she opted to set aside her personal hopes for a faithful marriage in order to ensure that she didn't risk the critical supply of military support in the event Charles' anger escalated further. Her innate kindness, make up of her character, her religion, gentle manner and lack of language skills,  had not equipped her to work on a level of undignified intrigue, sexual exploitation, manipulation or low handedness which may have allowed another woman success in both negotiations. It's not known why she changed her position; just that she changed her position. Catherine's thoughts during this time do not seem to be recorded, therefore passing a judgment on her character as \"weak\" may speak more to the biases of the historians than it does to the facts.  Without her \"voice\" we will never really know. </p>\n\n<p>Clarendon was crushed by the victory of his hated rival Castelmaine. In regards to the Queen, Clarendon expressed sympathy \"But the truth is, though she was of years enough to have had more experience in the world, and of as much wit as could be wished, and of a humour very agreeable at some seasons, yet she had been bred, according to the mode of discipline of her country, in a monastery, where she had only seen the women who attended her, and conversed with the religious who resided with her, and without doubt of her inclinations was enough disposed to have been one of that number. And from this restraint she was called out to be a great Queen, and to a free conversation in a court that was to be upon the matter new formed, and reduced from the manners of licentious age to old rules and limits which had been observed in better times; and to which regular and decent conformity the present disposition of men or women was not enough inclined to submit, nor the King enough disposed to exact\" (Clarendon, p. 319).</p>\n\n<p>England was stuck with a whore in the background emptying the monies of England, titles which were once passed out only for valor and honor now also served as \"payment\" to the women servicing Charles therefore diluting the worth of those deserving merit. Licentiousness became the norm of the court, corruption a way of life with Castlemaine dominating Charles and encouraging more splits in the political factions. Clarendon, broken at what he hoped had been a last chance to instill some sense of decency and decorum to the monarchy of Charles II confided in his friend Ormond \"I cannot tell you that I find, whatever other people discourse, my credit at all diminished with the king. He takes pains sometimes to persuade me the contrary. That which breaks my heart is that the same affections continue still, the same laziness and unconcernedness in business, and proportionable abatement of reputation\" (Wilson, p. 167). On an outward level and through the shiftiness of Charles all was well with Clarendon, or so he said, but clearly there was the beginning of a wedge between Charles and Clarendon. Although this wedge had been gently put in place Castlemaine went after it with a hammer of vengeance to drive it deeper between them at every chance. </p>\n\n<p>To the sadness of the Queen, who had only complied with her husband's command, she privately must have come to know that whatever thoughts of innocent happiness she had envisioned were over. She was followed around constantly by her new Lady of the Bedchamber who cruelly tormented her at every chance. Catherine masked her emotions and publicly put on a face of stoicism, which she wore throughout the parade of highly public mistresses which became the norm in her humiliating years as Charles's wife. History would reveal that perhaps the largest loss was for the people of England. Had her husband and country embraced her as her homeland wholeheartedly did, perhaps they too could have benefited from her strong and moral character. On her return to Portugal, Catherine emerged as a highly competent Regent of Portugal, who, at age 66, took on the French forces as they tried to dominate Spain and won some striking successes for the Portuguese people. Charles' choices -- the degrading treatment of his wife, his low friends, his vain and arrogant string of mistresses,  his aversion to work, and his licentious lifestyle moved England to an all time low.  Charles lived for Charles and Catherine lived for Portugal and her religion. However, in spite of all of his selfish insensitivities to her she never stopped loving, supporting and caring for him. </p>   \n\n<p>Hutton summarizes that \"the two individual victims of this series of events were the wretched Queen Catherine, and Clarendon...[but] the main casualty, however, was the King's reputation. By late 1662 an ambassador could quote the Londoners as saying that their sovereign only 'hunts and lusts', and other observers confirmed this opinion less concisely. Charles and Barbara had committed one of the great public adulteries of history, before a nation which a scant twelve years before had made the death penalty for this sin\u201d (Hutton, p.188-189).</p>\n\n<p>Sam\u2019s view of this intrigue as it develops is of interest as he sees only parts of it and struggles with the excitement of the physical and sexual beauty of Lady Castlemaine vs. what he believes to be morally right and what he believes to be good for the country. Sam works hard to learn new things, to grow, to achieve and to enrich his life; what a sharp contrast against a King who has everything and chooses to live his life at the lowest level. As we see in some of Sam\u2019s recent comments (ie. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/06/30/\">30 June 1662</a> \u201cObservations\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/07/16/\">16 July 1662</a>, for instance) he is growing to question if the hopes and promises of the Restoration will be achieved by this King, or if they will be cast aside in the pursuit of court gaieties and pleasures. It will be interesting to watch the entries to come and see how Sam actually experiences the hopes and dreams of this monarchy and how the choices made by Charles in this and follow on situations impact Sam\u2019s views of Charles, Castlemaine, Clarendon, Catherine and more importantly the state of the nation under this monarchy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special thanks:</strong> A very special thank you to this site\u2019s \u201cPedro\u201d for his untold hours spent translating the Portuguese works by Rau and Casimiro for me, and for offering an understanding of the Portuguese history and culture.

Charles' historians and biographers (Clarendon, Bryant, Hutton, Faulkus, Fraser, Coote, Ollard, Wilson, Ponsonby) and <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/\">Queen Catherine's</a> biographers (Strickland, Davidson, Mackay, Sousa, Rau, Casimiro, etc.), all differ somewhat in dates, details, descriptions and interpretations of the events, but most agree that the damage done here set a horrible precedent within the Royal marriage, the ministry, the court, the treasury, and even international relations. This entry is only intended as a general summary of some complex and detailed events so please forgive any deletions, inaccuracies, etc. and consider this for the more \"generalists\" among the background readers, as opposed to those who strive for exactness.  Some slight spoilers may be here but I've tried best to keep to the \"behind the scenes\" view that Sam did not see. </p>", 
            "text_html": "<p>Charles had married Catherine viewing the marriage as a state affair. In her naivety she may not have understood this and genuinely seems to have mistaken the attention given her by her husband during her honeymoon period to be real and sincere. With a total lack of experience in these matters, a devout belief in her marital vows and religion during their time at <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1765/\">Hampton Court</a> she truly fell in love with her husband.  What she did not see was that in the background, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/\">Lady Castlemaine</a>, who was the king's mistress had delivered a child and demanded Charles not only to claim it as his own but to repay her for her \"services\" to him by establishing her as his \"maitresse en title\". Through whatever means Castlemaine customarily used; rage filled outbursts, screaming, threats, tears, etc., she wore on Charles and he agreed to place her on the Queen's list as a Lady of the Bedchamber. This assigned role would imply that Castelmaine would have free access to attend to the Queen, follow her through her daily religious, public and personal routines and, through her presence, torment her by flaunting her public position as the King's lover.  The insult to the Queen was enormous and reflected an incredibly insensitive disregard to her feelings and position, not only as a human being, but also as a wife and hopefully, perhaps one day mother of a royal child.  Nowhere is it stated or believed by any historian (or even Charles, for that matter) that \"love\" had anything to do with Castlemaine's manoeuvres as money, greed, power, arrogance, vanity and position were her well known motives. She historically would and did use sex, blackmail, belittling or whatever extreme available to her to get what she wanted. Charles thought it easiest to succumb to Castlemaine's tantrums thinking that his \"docile\" little wife would accept his request due to her ignorance to the situation and her accommodating sweetness. Charles knew that Catherine was in love with him, so he assumed it would be easy to just slip Castlemaine onto the list and be done with it. If he was lucky, Catherine wouldn't even know she was being insulted.  He wasn't lucky. The one thing that Charles didn't know was that Catherine's mother had warned Catherine to \"never let Lady Castlemaine in your presence\". </p>\n\n<p>As Sam reports on this day, Catherine obliterated Lady Castlemaine's name from the list and returned it. What he won't see is that this humiliating, heartbreaking and personal insult to Catherine is followed by a series of confrontations and manoeuvres by Charles intended to force her to succumb to his command to accept Castlemaine.  As the conflict escalated Charles' court friends  \"used ever after all the ill Arts they could to make it disagreeable, and to alienate the King's Affections from the Queen to such a degree, that it might never be in her Power to prevail with him to their Disadvantage\". (Clarendon p. 317). After a period of lulling where Charles promised Catherine he would not push his request, he deceived her by bringing forth Castlemaine to publicly present her to the Queen at a court event. Catherine, not knowing who this woman even was, unknowingly acknowledged her. An attendant told her that this was Castlemaine.  Catherine, taken totally off guard, burst into tears, her nose began to bleed; she fainted away and had to be carried out of the room. Charles stayed behind thus publicly siding with Castlemaine. </p>\n\n<p>As the  tension intensified, Charles went to reprimand Catherine himself with the result being that  \"the passion and noise of the night reached too many ears to be a secret the next day; and the whole Court was full of that, which ought to have been known to nobody \" (Clarendon p. 334). Catherine demanded her return to Portugal if she could not be treated with the respect of a wife and be allowed to have control of her own household. Although the return home was a na&iuml;ve request on her part which would cause repercussions in international diplomacy if entertained, the painfulness of Catherine's statement was a huge blow to Charles' ego and hurt him terribly. No woman had ever even considered walking away from him before. He retaliated by telling her to be sure that they even wanted her in Portugal as they had sent her without the contracted dowry and hadn't delivered on the money as promised (something which most historians believe that Catherine had no previous knowledge of). She was devastated, embarrassed for her country and national pride. Charles was now adamant, Catherine was not only to accept Castlemaine to her bedchamber, but also acknowledge her socially in public.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next weeks, \"Charles applied crueler and cruder pressure\" (Hutton, p 187) and Davidson reports that Charles sent almost all of Catherine's Portuguese attendants back to Portugal, he threw Diego Silvas (the Portuguese Jew who accompanied her and was responsible for paying the dowry) into jail even though the payment was not yet due. He was rude to the Portuguese <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2752/\">Ambassador De Sande</a> (Catherine's godfather). He publicly ignored her and paraded Lady Castlemaine around, flaunting her, flirting with her and showering her with affection while he made sure that his wife was abandoned. Clarendon reports that \"His Majesty was in continual conference with her [Castlemaine] whilst the Queen sat untaken notice of; and if her Majesty rose at the indignity and retired into her chamber, it may be one or two attended her; but all the company remained in the room she had left, and too often said those things which nobody ought to have whispered. She alone was left out of all jollities, and not suffered to have any part in those pleasant applications and caresses that she saw made abroad to everybody else; a universal mirth in all company but hers, and in all place but in her chamber, her own servants showing more respect and more diligence to the person of the Lady [Castlemaine] than towards their own mistress, who, they found, could do them no good\" (Clarendon,p. 341). Nobody dared publicly side with the Queen for fear of Charles' rage. Castlemaine's court friends urged Charles to stand firm.</p>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, Charles dumped the dirty work on <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/\">Clarendon</a> and told him to make his wife succumb or else. Clarendon, who morally sided with the Queen and passionately hated Castlemaine, was stuck in the position of asking Catherine to succumb to his King's request. \"Clarendon saw the manners and morals of the educated world into which he had been born the real object of the Restoration\" (Ollard,p. 135) and Castlemaine, a vulgar mannered, arrogant whore when at her best, was the enemy to all of those things that Clarendon sought to restore. Clarendon did confront Charles on his actions but as a result of his questioning of the King he received the following letter of scathing rebuke:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...And I wish I may be unhappy in this world and all the world to come if I fail in the least degree of which I an resolved, which is of making my Lady Castlemaine of my wife's bedchamber, and whosoever I find use any endeavor to hinder this resolution of mine (except it be only to myself) I will be his enemy to the last moment of my life. You know how true a friend I have been to you. If you will oblige me eternally, make this business as easy as you can, of what opinion soever you are. For I am resolved to go through with this matter, let what you will come of it, which I solomnly swear before Almighty God. Therefore if you desire to have continuance of my friendship, meddle no more in my business, except it be to bear down all false, scandalous reports and to facilitate what I am sure my honour is so much concerned in. And whosoever I find be to be my Lady Castlemaine's enemy in this matter, I do promise upon my word to be his enemy as long as I live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Wilson p. 168). Clarendon lost his spine and tried to persuade Catherine to succumb as he'd been ordered to. </p>\n\n<p>In a letter from France dated 22 July 1662, Charles' most beloved sister <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1272/\">Henrietta</a> wrote to him shocked at his behavior and defending the Queen. \"You tell me that someone has spoken ill of a certain person, to the Queen your wife. Alas, is it possible that such things are really said? I who know your innocence can only wonder! But to speak seriously, I beg you to tell me how the Queen has taken this. Here people say that she is in deepest distress and to speak frankly I think she has only to good reason for her grief\" (Wilson, p. 168). It all fell on deaf ears. </p>\n\n<p>On another front, Portugal was facing difficulties. They needed the arrival of the English troops as promised in the marriage contract. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5039/\">Queen Luisa</a> was facing the overthrow of her reign and a takeover by a section of the government led by Castel Melhor (under the guise of her unfit son <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5040/\">Alfonso</a>, who would then easily be pushed aside, due to his lack of competence). The dowry was still unpaid without hopes to raise the money. The potential crisis in her homeland, the return of her entourage to Portugal and her concerns for her family weighed heavily on Catherine. She may have come to England with a young girl's hopeful heart, betting on her future as wife to a legend of a husband and open to her first experience with love, but the essence of her person, her worth and identity were and always would be first with Portugal and the duty she carried with her to support her nation. </p>\n\n<p>\"Over the next few weeks the king's attitude hardened towards the queen and those who took her part with severity and even uncharacteristic cruelty. He had boxed himself into a corner and had done so publicly. He could not yield without losing face and authority. The more he was accused by people he loved and respected (and probably his own conscious) of being unkind and unreasonable, the more steadfastly he stuck to his guns\" (Wilson, p. 165). Charles took the position that to waiver from his request would imply that he was ruled by his wife, which would be an insult to his honor. \"Here we have Charles in his most contradictory aspect. He prated of his honor, the while he insisted on forcing upon the woman who by all moral and spiritual laws had the highest claim to his consideration, the companionship of one whom he should have been ashamed to mention in Catherine's presence\" (Ponsoby, p 114). \"Beneath her canopy of cloth of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              supported on pillars wreathed with flowers, the frightened, isolated Catherine was reaching her breaking point\".

And from this restraint she was called out to be a great Queen, and to a free conversation in a court that was to be upon the matter new formed, and reduced from the manners of licentious age to old rules and limits which had been observed in better times; and to which regular and decent conformity the present disposition of men or women was not enough inclined to submit, nor the King enough disposed to exact\" (Clarendon, p. 319).</p>\n\n<p>England was stuck with a whore in the background emptying the monies of England, titles which were once passed out only for valor and honor now also served as \"payment\" to the women servicing Charles therefore diluting the worth of those deserving merit. Licentiousness became the norm of the court, corruption a way of life with Castlemaine dominating Charles and encouraging more splits in the political factions. Clarendon, broken at what he hoped had been a last chance to instill some sense of decency and decorum to the monarchy of Charles II confided in his friend Ormond \"I cannot tell you that I find, whatever other people discourse, my credit at all diminished with the king. He takes pains sometimes to persuade me the contrary. That which breaks my heart is that the same affections continue still, the same laziness and unconcernedness in business, and proportionable abatement of reputation\" (Wilson, p. 167). On an outward level and through the shiftiness of Charles all was well with Clarendon, or so he said, but clearly there was the beginning of a wedge between Charles and Clarendon. Although this wedge had been gently put in place Castlemaine went after it with a hammer of vengeance to drive it deeper between them at every chance. </p>\n\n<p>To the sadness of the Queen, who had only complied with her husband's command, she privately must have come to know that whatever thoughts of innocent happiness she had envisioned were over. She was followed around constantly by her new Lady of the Bedchamber who cruelly tormented her at every chance. Catherine masked her emotions and publicly put on a face of stoicism, which she wore throughout the parade of highly public mistresses which became the norm in her humiliating years as Charles's wife. History would reveal that perhaps the largest loss was for the people of England. Had her husband and country embraced her as her homeland wholeheartedly did, perhaps they too could have benefited from her strong and moral character. On her return to Portugal, Catherine emerged as a highly competent Regent of Portugal, who, at age 66, took on the French forces as they tried to dominate Spain and won some striking successes for the Portuguese people. Charles' choices -- the degrading treatment of his wife, his low friends, his vain and arrogant string of mistresses,  his aversion to work, and his licentious lifestyle moved England to an all time low.  Charles lived for Charles and Catherine lived for Portugal and her religion. However, in spite of all of his selfish insensitivities to her she never stopped loving, supporting and caring for him. </p>\n\n<p>Hutton summarizes that \"the two individual victims of this series of events were the wretched Queen Catherine, and Clarendon...[but] the main casualty, however, was the King's reputation. By late 1662 an ambassador could quote the Londoners as saying that their sovereign only 'hunts and lusts', and other observers confirmed this opinion less concisely. Charles and Barbara had committed one of the great public adulteries of history, before a nation which a scant twelve years before had made the death penalty for this sin\u201d (Hutton, p.188-189).</p>\n\n<p>Sam\u2019s view of this intrigue as it develops is of interest as he sees only parts of it and struggles with the excitement of the physical and sexual beauty of Lady Castlemaine vs. what he believes to be morally right and what he believes to be good for the country. Sam works hard to learn new things, to grow, to achieve and to enrich his life; what a sharp contrast against a King who has everything and chooses to live his life at the lowest level. As we see in some of Sam\u2019s recent comments (ie. <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/06/30/\">30 June 1662</a> \u201cObservations\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/07/16/\">16 July 1662</a>, for instance) he is growing to question if the hopes and promises of the Restoration will be achieved by this King, or if they will be cast aside in the pursuit of court gaieties and pleasures. It will be interesting to watch the entries to come and see how Sam actually experiences the hopes and dreams of this monarchy and how the choices made by Charles in this and follow on situations impact Sam\u2019s views of Charles, Castlemaine, Clarendon, Catherine and more importantly the state of the nation under this monarchy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special thanks:</strong> A very special thank you to this site\u2019s \u201cPedro\u201d for his untold hours spent translating the Portuguese works by Rau and Casimiro for me, and for offering an understanding of the Portuguese history and culture.
