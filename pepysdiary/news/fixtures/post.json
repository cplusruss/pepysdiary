It's been two-and-a-half years since <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2010/01/04/10717.php\">I last gave a detailed update</a>, so let's so what's changed...</p>", 
            "title": "Site statistics 2012", 
            "text": "## Diary, Encyclopedia and annotations\n\nThe complete Diary had **3,434 entries** posted over its nine years and five months, and it has accumulated **58,603 annotations**. That's an average of 17 annotations per Diary entry, a figure that's shrunk over time (it was 19 in January 2010 and 20 in July 2008). \n\nHere's a tiny graph showing the number of annotations posted over the past four months, which makes the end of the Diary quite obvious:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/diary_annotations.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/diary_annotations.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"72\" alt=\"Graph showing recent annotations on the Diary\"></a>\n\nThe [Encyclopedia](http://www.pepysdiary.com/background/) now has **4,790 topics** and has **9,425 annotations**, an average of about two per topic. Here's a graph of those over the past four months:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/encyclopedia_annotations.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/encyclopedia_annotations.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"71\" alt=\"Graph showing recent annotations on the Encyclopedia\"></a>\n\nOf those 4,790 topics, **2,694 are [people](http://www.pepysdiary.com/background/people.php)** and some of them have the small portrait images that appear over their links in Diary entries. Here's an image which shows all the people who do (and don't) have their own portrait (click to see it bigger):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/faces_big.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/faces_small.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" alt=\"People with portraits in the Diary\"></a>\n\nMore than half of the 4,790 Encyclopedia topics, **2,549**, contain content from Wikipedia.\n\n[In-Depth Articles](http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/) has **256** comments and [Site News](http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/news/) has **1,297**. Added to the **4** annotations in [Letters](http://www.pepysdiary.com/letters/) that makes a total of **69,585 across the whole site**.\n\nThere are now something like **56,642** hyperlinks between words in Diary entries and topics in the Encyclopedia.\n\n\n## Visitors, page views etc\n\nLooking at April 2012 (as May was unusual), the site had **57,397 Visits** from **28,297 Unique Visitors** (i.e., different people), resulting in **134,723 Page Views**. The average visit duration was **3m 11s**. Of those Visits, **44.44%** were \"new\" (i.e., people who hadn't been before).\n\nLooking at the data since 16 November 2005 (the earliest I have Google Analytics data for), it's surprising how consistent every one of these measures has been. There has perhaps been a very gradual reduction over time, but it's hardly noticeable.\n\nHere are two graphs, showing the changes over time (click for larger versions):\n\nUnique Visitors, by week (see also [by day](http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/unique_visitors_days.png) or [by month](http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/unique_visitors_months.png)):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/unique_visitors_weeks.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/unique_visitors_weeks_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"55\" alt=\"Unique Visitors per week\"></a>\n\nPageviews, by week (see also [by day](http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/pageviews_days.png) or [by month](http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/pageviews_months.png)):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/pageviews_weeks.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/pageviews_weeks_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"55\" alt=\"Pageviews per week\"></a>\n\n(The drop to zero in 2007 is due to a technical error, probably on my part.)\n\nHere's a map showing where Visits have come from since 16 November 2005 (**5,034,512 Visits**):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/visits_map.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/visits_map_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"295\" alt=\"Visits map\"></a>\n\nThis table shows the top 25 countries in terms of number of Visits, again since 16 November 2005:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/visits_table.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/visits_table_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"489\" alt=\"Visits table\"></a>\n\nI think this table shows that around 48% of visits were one-offs, with that person not returning. But we can also see that nearly 40% of people visited 9 or more times. (I'm a bit hazy about this table, so I may be misinterpreting it.)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/count_of_visits.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/count_of_visits_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" alt=\"Count of visits table\"></a>\n\nThis chart shows where people came to the site from, since 16 November 2005. I think Direct Traffic is people visiting from a bookmark or typing in the URL, while Referral Traffic is people following a link from somewhere other than a search engine (which is Search Traffic):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/sources.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/sources.png\" width=\"352\" height=\"188\" alt=\"Sources\"></a>\n\nHere are the top 25 things people searched for on search engines to get here (numbers in brackets are the number of visits for that search term during since 16 November 2005):\n\n1. samuel pepys (169,964)\n2. pepys diary (111,732)\n3. samuel pepys diary (77,251)\n4. pepys (69,504)\n5. diary (42,916)\n6.

I ended up omitting most of the browsers that were clustered at or below the 1% share mark, leaving the four most popular:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/browsers_graph.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/browsers_graph_thumb.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"235\" alt=\"Browsers graph\"></a>\n\n(2005 is only based on 16 November to 31 December, and 2012 is based on 1 January to 4 July.)\n\n##\u00a0RSS feeds and email\n\nNext, a summary of how many people read the site via [RSS or email](http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/formats/0 (possibly in addition to on the web). The main Diary feed has **1,990 subscribers**, the Story So Far feed has **85 subscribers**, the Encyclopedia **78 subscribers**, Site News **110** and In-Depth Articles **54**. By the end of the Diary **391 people** were receiving the entries by email.\n\nThese are mostly quite a bit lower than in 2010 and this graph, showing the number of subscribers to the Diary feed since October 2007 does look a bit strange:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/rss.png\"><img src=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/static/img/news/2012/07/05/rss.png\" width=\"460\" height=\"117\" alt=\"RSS graph\"></a>\n\nI've no idea why things changed so much from 2011, including one big sudden drop in March 2011.\n\n## Twitter\n\nThe number of people following [@samuelpepys](http://twitter.com/samuelpepys) continued to grow steadily, right up to the end of the Diary, and he currently has **31,398 followers**. I suspect that there isn't much overlap between the people who followed the fragments of Sam's diary on Twitter, and those of you who read the full diary entries via this site.\n\nAnd that's it! If there are any other figures you're interested in which I haven't covered, let me know and I'll see what I can dig out.",

It will probably feature links to diary entries for the current day in all the years of the diary, and probably all or some of the text for one of them.\n\nI'll probably include other things yet to be decided: Links to (and maybe excerpts of) interesting or popular diary entries or periods (such as the [Great Fire](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/)). Links to [In-Depth Articles](http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/) or particularly good [Encyclopedia](http://www.pepysdiary.com/background/) entries. Any other ideas welcome!\n\nOther than the front page, the website will definitely stay much as it is, and will remain online.\n\n### What definitely won't happen\n\n* [The front page](http://www.pepysdiary.com/) of the site won't immediately \"start again\" by beginning to show diary entries in sequence from the first year of the diary (1660).\n* [The RSS feed](http://www.pepysdiary.com/syndication/full.rdf) won't immediately start again with 1660's diary entries (it won't be updating at all).\n* [The daily emails](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/emailverifySubmit?feedId=1245958&loc=en_US) won't immediately start again with diary entries from 1660.\n* [@samuelpepys on Twitter](http://twitter.com/samuelpepys) won't immediately start tweeting 1660's events.\n\nAfter running this site for nearly a decade I'm looking forward to a break from having to pay it attention (even if only a small amount at times!) so often.\n\nAlso, it seems more appropriate that we should accept that Pepys has stopped writing. It was a big event for him, and it should be a big event for us -- re-starting things immediately diminishes the effect I think.\n\n###\u00a0What might happen\n\nI *might* turn off the ability to add new annotations at some point after the diary ends -- I expect there won't be many new ones added after a while. But the site still has to filter an awful lot of spam annotations and, eventually, it may be simpler to accept no new annotations at all.\n\nWhen 2013 starts, I *might* start showing the diary again, in order, on the front page, in the RSS feed, and by email, from 1st January 1660. If so, it *might* be a \"read-only\" experience, with annotations turned off. As I'll already have all the diary entries in the system, with all their links, this shouldn't require much of my time once it's set up.\n\nAt the start of 2013 I *might* also start @samuelpepys on Twitter again, from 1660. I'd like to see this happen, because I enjoy his tweets, but it would be more work -- I only have the final few years of the diary already prepared in tweet form from this time around.\n\n### That's it\n\nSo, that's it.

Here's the press release from [this page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2011/wk33/mon.shtml):", 
            "text_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Samuel Pepys was 26 in January 1660, when he decided to record his daily life and innermost thoughts. Kris Marshall stars in this new adaptation of his diaries by Hattie Naylor.</p>\n<p>Two years after a life-threatening operation to remove a bladder stone Pepys is feeling pretty well \u2013 despite having a lot on his mind.</p>\n<p>He's behind with his rent, he goes out too often, and drinks too much. He lies awake worrying about work and, despite being happily married, can't keep his hands off other women.</p>\n<p>For the next 10 years, in his secret diary, Samuel Pepys faithfully records the day's events, and confesses his innermost thoughts.</p>\n<p>He reveals what people in the 17th century ate, wore, did for fun and what they expected of marriage and of love affairs.</p>\n<p>Hattie Naylor's new adaptation features Katharine Jakeways as Samuel Pepys's wife, Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>Producer/Kate McAll for the BBC</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I expect it will be available after broadcast <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer\">on the BBC iPlayer</a> but I imagine this will only be for UK listeners.</p>",

            "title": "Coins and Experiments", 
            "text": "The first is about changes in coinage in the late 17th century:\n\n>  [William](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/) [III, Prince of Orange] had been dealt a difficult hand. The national stock of sixpences, shillings, half-crowns and crowns fell into two groups, the old and the new, each with a total face value of around ten million pounds. The old coins, dating from before 1662, had been made by brawny \u2018master moneyers\u2019 in the Mint workshops at the Tower of London, chopping slices from a silver rod and striking an image on both sides using a hammer and die. Apart from being easy to counterfeit, these hammered coins had become seriously degraded, partly through ordinary use (many were more than a century old) and partly through deliberate tampering: the manufacturing process left a fringe beyond the imprint of the die, and anyone with clippers or a file could shave a little silver off a hammered coin. By the 1690s, most old coins had lost about a third of their original substance.\n> \n> In 1662 the Royal Mint went over to a new method of manufacture. Samuel Pepys, who was one of the first to make a tour of the new workshops at the Tower, was enchanted by his glimpse of a pioneering form of mass production. He watched perfectly uniform discs of assayed silver pouring out of horse-powered presses; he saw them locked into machines that engraved a pattern on the edge and added the defiant legend <em>decus et tutamen</em> (\u2018ornament and safeguard\u2019 \u2013 milled coins would be proof against clipping and filing); and he saw them slipped under mechanical hammers that struck deep impressions on both sides with a clarity and precision that the strongest old-style moneyer could never have matched. \u2018They say that this way is more charge to the king than the old way,\u2019 Pepys wrote, \u2018but it is neater, freer from clipping or counterfeiting \u2026 and speedier.\u2019\n> \n> The new British coins, beautifully minted with a full measure of fine silver, were a source of national pride; but they were also a national folly. They were harder to counterfeit than the old ones, but just as easy to melt down, either to forge old-style coins at a higher face value, or to create bullion that could be sold overseas at a premium. The Mint set an extra trap for itself by issuing a run of high-value coins struck not from silver but from the finest African gold, popularly known as guineas. They were originally meant to be worth 20 shillings, but they had no explicit denomination and were soon trading at 21 or 22. By the time William was pleading for cash to pay his troops in Flanders, guineas were worth 30 shillings, offering a mute but implacable commentary on the value of the British coinage. It was a hard problem; but something had to be done.\n\n[Here's the diary entry](http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/05/19/) in which Pepys is impressed by the new techniques. There's a bit more, in which John Locke insists that coins have an intrinsic, \"natural\" value due to their silver content, rather than the purely symbolic value we acknowledge currency to have these days, but that's probably a big enough quote already. It's from [a review](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n02/jonathan-ree/newton-reinvents-himself) of Thomas Levenson's <cite>Newton and the Counterfeiter</cite> by Jonathan R\u00e9e. \n\nFor completeness, the other good Pepys-mentioning article was [this review](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n02/steven-shapin/good-housekeeping) of Ted McCormick's <cite>William Petty and the Ambitions of Political Arithmetic</cite> by Steven Shapin, about the polymath, [Petty](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1020/), who designed a kind of catamaran, the [<em>Experiment</em>](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4001/) in the 1660s:\n\n> The ship was an experiment in science, technology and entrepreneurship. No one had ever seen such a vessel; it violated the conventions of the shipwright\u2019s art; and among the knowledgeable it was generally an object of ridicule and opposition. There was, Petty acknowledged, \u2018scarce a good word for it\u2019 from anyone in the business. Most experts thought it wouldn\u2019t work, and some worried that, in the unlikely event it did, it would be a technology too far. Samuel Pepys, the Navy Board\u2019s clerk of the acts, was a supporter, while the master shipwright [Anthony Deane](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/) said Petty\u2019s design \u2018must needs prove a folly\u2019. The navy commissioner [Peter Pett](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/) told Pepys that the double-hulled ship was \u2018the most dangerous thing in the world\u2019: if it was successful, the secret would get out, and it would be the ruin of English trade and sea power. The Dutch, with whom England was about to fight the second instalment of a series of naval wars, might use the shallow-draught ship to sail right up the Thames and lay London waste.\n\nOn [13th February 1665](http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/02/13/), Pepys calls the ship \"a brave roomy vessel.\" The whole article is well worth a read.\n\nDo drop me a line if you happen to come across any other Pepys-related snippets around the place that could be highlighted here.",

            "title": "Business Standard article and a Pepys walk", 
            "text": "> In 2003, a quirky and enterprising young web designer named Phil Gyford realised that Pepys\u2019s diary was tailor-made for the Internet age. So he started putting it online: as a blog. Every day Gyford uploads a new entry to PepysDiary.com, exactly as Pepys wrote it, and on the same calendar day. Thus, on his website, now seven years into the diary, it is January 9 of both 1667 and 2010.\n>\n> In the way these things work, Pepys has now collected his own 21st-century community -- a cohort of dedicated Pepys followers who await their daily dose of the 1660s. Because much about 17th-century London is opaque or mysterious to the modern reader, Gyford designed the blog so that knowledgeable readers could annotate each entry on their own. Every Pepys entry draws a train of comments, and out of this small space a community has grown.\n>\n> I find this fascinating. It well reflects modern patterns of Internet-based fannish sociability -- many strangers communing over an abstraction.

            "text_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>In 2003, a quirky and enterprising young web designer named Phil Gyford realised that Pepys\u2019s diary was tailor-made for the Internet age. So he started putting it online: as a blog. Every day Gyford uploads a new entry to PepysDiary.com, exactly as Pepys wrote it, and on the same calendar day. Thus, on his website, now seven years into the diary, it is January 9 of both 1667 and 2010.</p>\n<p>In the way these things work, Pepys has now collected his own 21st-century community -- a cohort of dedicated Pepys followers who await their daily dose of the 1660s. Because much about 17th-century London is opaque or mysterious to the modern reader, Gyford designed the blog so that knowledgeable readers could annotate each entry on their own. Every Pepys entry draws a train of comments, and out of this small space a community has grown.</p>\n<p>I find this fascinating. It well reflects modern patterns of Internet-based fannish sociability -- many strangers communing over an abstraction. Yet it also reflects Pepys\u2019s own times, because the readers become amateur scholars and conversants. This reverses decades of academic specialisation; yet it highlights the academicisation of so much of our public discourse.

It was a relatively quiet year as I didn't add many [new features](http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/new-features/) or re-design anything major. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the total number of hours spent on various tasks over 2009:\n\n<table class=\"valign-bottom\">\n<tr>\n<th>Task</th><th class=\"number\">Hours</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preparing diary entries (including Twitter posts)</td><td class=\"number\">117.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2009/08/08/10261.php\">Adding pictures to hover \"tool tip\" links</a></td><td class=\"number\">12.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dealing with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2008/10/\">flagged annotations</a></td><td class=\"number\">5.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fixing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2008/10/\">truncated comments</a></td><td class=\"number\">4.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2009/05/10/9971.php\">Writing a script to automate posting to Twitter</a></td><td class=\"number\">3.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>General fixing of broken things</td><td class=\"number\">3.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Publishing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/history/1666/\">Story So Far</a> summaries</td><td class=\"number\">1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Writing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/news/\">Site News</a></td><td class=\"number\">1.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Publishing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/\">In-Depth Articles</a></td><td class=\"number\">0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Miscellaneous other tasks</td><td class=\"number\">2.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td class=\"number\"><strong>150.5</strong></td></tr>\n</table>\n  \n\nThere were probably lots of little bits here and there I forgot to time but that's about it for a quiet twelve months: 150.5 hours, or nearly **four working weeks** per year. \n\n\n## Thanks\n\nFinally, as this is sort of a wrap-up of the past year I'd like to thank everyone for reading the site and to everyone who's posted an annotation.\n\nI'd also like to offer special thanks to three people:\n\n* **Terry Foreman**, who has offered many corrections and suggestions to make the Encyclopedia and linking to it better.\n* **Jeannine Kerwin**, who has continued to write the monthly Story So Far summaries.\n* **Max Wainer**, who has been diligently alerting me to hundreds of annotations which were truncated by an old database move, only a fraction of which I've had time to fix so far.\n\nThanks again to everyone, and I hope 2010 (and 1667) is a good year for you all!",

It was a relatively quiet year as I didn't add many <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/new-features/\">new features</a> or re-design anything major. </p>\n<p>Here's the breakdown of the total number of hours spent on various tasks over 2009:</p>\n<table class=\"valign-bottom\">\n<tr>\n<th>Task</th><th class=\"number\">Hours</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preparing diary entries (including Twitter posts)</td><td class=\"number\">117.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2009/08/08/10261.php\">Adding pictures to hover \"tool tip\" links</a></td><td class=\"number\">12.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dealing with <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2008/10/\">flagged annotations</a></td><td class=\"number\">5.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fixing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2008/10/\">truncated comments</a></td><td class=\"number\">4.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/archive/2009/05/10/9971.php\">Writing a script to automate posting to Twitter</a></td><td class=\"number\">3.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>General fixing of broken things</td><td class=\"number\">3.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Publishing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/history/1666/\">Story So Far</a> summaries</td><td class=\"number\">1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Writing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/about/news/\">Site News</a></td><td class=\"number\">1.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Publishing <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/\">In-Depth Articles</a></td><td class=\"number\">0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Miscellaneous other tasks</td><td class=\"number\">2.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td class=\"number\"><strong>150.5</strong></td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>There were probably lots of little bits here and there I forgot to time but that's about it for a quiet twelve months: 150.5 hours, or nearly <strong>four working weeks</strong> per year. </p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n<p>Finally, as this is sort of a wrap-up of the past year I'd like to thank everyone for reading the site and to everyone who's posted an annotation.</p>\n<p>I'd also like to offer special thanks to three people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Terry Foreman</strong>, who has offered many corrections and suggestions to make the Encyclopedia and linking to it better.</li>\n<li><strong>Jeannine Kerwin</strong>, who has continued to write the monthly Story So Far summaries.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Wainer</strong>, who has been diligently alerting me to hundreds of annotations which were truncated by an old database move, only a fraction of which I've had time to fix so far.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks again to everyone, and I hope 2010 (and 1667) is a good year for you all!</p>",

But as soon as someone overtakes the whole thing seems easily dismissable as a trivial popularity contest! No matter, it was a lot of fun, and congratulations to all the other sites who were also nominated. Ultimately the award is only a reflection of how many readers a site has and how much the site owner is willing to encourage them to vote (I suspect [McSweeney's](http://www.mcsweeneys.net) would have been first or second if they'd linked to the awards).\n\nOn the final day of polling Hans Dekker of the [Wordsy weblog](http://www.wordsy.com/) interviewed me about Pepys' Diary and the awards and he's just [posted the edited half hour MP3](http://www.wordsy.com/podcast/2007-nov-10-episode_-twp018_final_hans_dekker) on his site.

The day before voting closed we were 3-400 votes behind [Neil Gaiman's Journal](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal) but on the final day we'd caught up and got nearly 100 votes ahead. So thanks to all of you who made the effort, and particularly those of you who emailed many more people asking for their support (and thanks to all the friends and colleagues of mine who voted and encouraged others to take part too).", 
            "text_html": "<p>Unfortunately, a couple of hours before polling closed, Gaiman posted <a href=\"http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/11/reminder.html\">a reminder</a> about the awards on his site and his many fans swiftly saw him add around 1,500 votes before it was all over. </p>\n<p>When one is ahead in votes like these then the award seems like a perfectly judged validation of a site's quality. But as soon as someone overtakes the whole thing seems easily dismissable as a trivial popularity contest! No matter, it was a lot of fun, and congratulations to all the other sites who were also nominated. Ultimately the award is only a reflection of how many readers a site has and how much the site owner is willing to encourage them to vote (I suspect <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net\">McSweeney's</a> would have been first or second if they'd linked to the awards).</p>\n<p>On the final day of polling Hans Dekker of the <a href=\"http://www.wordsy.com/\">Wordsy weblog</a> interviewed me about Pepys' Diary and the awards and he's just <a href=\"http://www.wordsy.com/podcast/2007-nov-10-episode_-twp018_final_hans_dekker\">posted the edited half hour MP3</a> on his site. I hope you find it interesting listening!</p>",

Some of the Wikipedia images will also appear in the right-hand column whichever tab you view on an Encyclopedia page. \n\nHopefully this helps expand the information we have in the Encyclopedia, and the inclusion of these pictures will bring things to life a bit more, with very little work on my or your parts.

The Wikipedia text will provide a good general background on a topic, but editors can write something that's more directly relevant to the world of Pepys. See, for example, Jeannine Kerwin's piece on [Sir Edward Mountagu](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/).\n\nI've only added the Wikipedia text for a few topics at the moment, and will work my way through everything else gradually. It will mostly be people who were prominent enough to deserve Wikipedia pages, and places that are well known enough. The are some topics with Wikipedia pages that it might not be worth including. For example, I'm not sure there's much to be gained from using content from [the Wikipedia page on wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine) on our own [wine page](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/) as it's of such a general nature. But I'd be happy to hear your opinion.\n\nAnyway, I hope this adds to the usefulness of the Encyclopedia and makes the diary even more interesting!",

Although Movable Type does a good job of filtering the spam from the real requests for links, the spammers still try. Every time they \"ping\" the TrackBack script it causes a little bit of work for the web server.</p>\n\n<p>Recently the script received more than 20,000 hits in a single hour, causing the computer that my websites share with other peoples' websites to slow to a crawl. Understandably, the company that runs the web server disabled the TrackBack script. It's probably best if I leave it that way for good.</p>\n\n<p>I'll try to find time to write some code to keep the Encyclopedia references up to date, but for a while I'm afraid they won't be updating.

While we didn't reach a conclusion, I think it's worth a go.

It's not a perfect solution but often \"good enough\" is perfectly fine. If nothing else, it's a good first step.</p>\n\n<p>You can view messages either on the site or via email and I'd encourage you to sign up if you can spare any time for more discussion. Hopefully we'll be discussing how best to use the group to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>I should say though that 95% of the diary annotations are fine as they are and I see the new group as an addition to, rather than a replacement for, anything on this site.

The reason I haven't done this before is because I'm attempting to keep the diary content as close to the original as the web format (and the translations through Victorian editors and Project Gutenberg's processes) allow. Pepys' diaries included the month and year at the head of a page and each entry was marked with just the date. Occasionally he seems to have noted Sundays, but not always.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question is, do I include weekdays on each entry, and if so how? Feel free to discuss this below...</p>",
