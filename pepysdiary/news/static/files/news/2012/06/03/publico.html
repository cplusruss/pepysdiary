<h1>Samuel Pepys: In the Age of Blogs</h1>

<p><strong>A subject of Charles II wrote a diary for nearly every-one of the seventeenth century. There are ten years, the web designer Phil Gyford had the idea of a blog for the day to day. The task ends May 31</strong></p>

<p>Phil Gyford lives in London and enjoy the city where he lives. Therefore, there are ten years thought that he lacked the daily reading of Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) - English member of Parliament who worked on the British Admiralty and was responsible for important naval reforms - for being a "document so interesting about the history of city."</p>

<p>At the time, this web designer and programmer followed many blogs that were actu-night stays with daily posts, and the parallel between a diary and a blog seemed so obvious that you've thought someone would have remembered to translate the diary of Pepys for the Web . "After all, I found that not, so I thought that I should do. I thought I read a daily entry per day would be less intimidating to think of them read and see a shelf full of rail-packets," says Phil Gyford, by email.</p>

<p>The print edition of the diaries - that go from 1 January 1660 a May 31, 1669 - and consists of several volumes. Pepys stopped writing the diary, which lasted almost a decade when he began having vision problems, for fear of going blind.</p>

<p>Phil Gyford, 41, began working on this project in late 2002 and transcribed the first entry of the seventeenth century the daily blog <cite>The diaries of Samuel Pepys</cite> (www.pepysdiary.com/) on January 1, 2003. Your method of work has been to prepare the blog entries and more recently Twitter (@samuelpepys) for the entire week. And then, day by day, the posts are published auto-matically, without your intervention. When absent or went on vacation, preparing in advance entries and so the task endured for nearly a decade. Did this tra-ment alone, and some volunteers to write articles for the Ram site were pointing out errors and making suggestions. When asked if they ever had doubts in taking the job until the end says, "All the time!" [Always]</p>

<p>Confesses that not much concerned about the statistics of the site - which was making publitions - but if I knew almost nobody was wanting es-read daily would probably have to-do. "It would be a task too boring and prolonged the time to continue to do if no one were to take advantage dis-so. Since I had some readers, and people had to put notes, was enough to be worth it."</p>

<p>Their task will finish it in the next weeks, to May 31, the day he put the last entry. Thereafter, Gyford not have plans. "The site where this will continue but not back to being updated," he explains, although some readers have suggested that he return to the beginning.</p>

<p>To celebrate the end of the project, heating-le who also helped build the website TheyWorkForYou.com (which brought together the members of the British Parliament), organizou the May 26, a guided tour of London followed by Samuel Pepys lunch. Jeannine Kerwin, who already wrote the blo-gue, will make a long article about how was the life of Samuel Pepys and his wife after the end of the diary which had been available online.</p>

<p>Since the start that Phil Gyford believed that these would give an optimal daily blog, but when we want to know if over the years their expectations were exceeded, not sure. What do you know that the daily and became "a good blog."</p>

<p>To not have problems with copyright, Phil Gyford chosen by the online version of the diaries published in 1893, which was entered into by volunteers from Project Gutenberg [the oldest digital library, founded by Michael Hart] and was already available the Internet in 2003. Victorian is an issue that lacks some of the extracts from "delicious" but has several notes.</p>

<p>"It's interesting that Samuel Pepys has es-scribed so a detailed diary every day, for almost ten years - and there are few, and that there are some examples that may be similar accounts of everyday life for so many of them secu. But what makes it even more interesting and Pepys combines events altissima impor-tance (such as meetings with the King, the organization Navy, etc..) With the description of experience of the mundane day-to-day of the seventeenth century: buying new clothes, diseases, food, conversations with the maids, to theater visits, trips by parents, etc.. He is best known for the daily infidelities that counted - the descriptions that made them and the guilt of having done made it more real and honest and do not show that he wrote the diary to show for an audience," says Gyford.</p>

<p>In one of the entries, Samuel Pepys describes a discussion he had with his wife, Elizabeth Pepys (1640-1669), with whom she had married 15 years. Account that awoke the morning of January 9, 1663, a Friday after a night spent in the theater, and saw Elizabeth in tears. She complained of feeling very alone. Between sobs, she asked the maid to fetch Jane a small bau from which he drew a series of papers, including a letter he had written to her husband there two months, where he explained the reasons for all his unhappiness. It was a letter he had read and had not burned, but she was sighted, had made a copy and would read it aloud pa-ra that he heard it. Samuel Pepys writes in the diary that he felt that what she was reading was "so real", he was afraid they would stop the hands of others. From here is a description of your competition for those roles that women held as he got out of bed and tried to wear.</p>

<p>This episode and referred to by biographer Claire Tomalin <cite>Samuel Pepys - The Unequalled Self</cite> (2002 Whitbread Book of the Year, published by Penguin), who comments: "We know all this because he himself described it. When it goes to the paper, Samuel Pepys distanced itself from the man on the scene. He looked at himself as he looked at Elizabeth, or the maid Jane, looked like the night before for the actors and the audience in the theater. The conflicting emotions that transmits - indignation and anger, pity for the woman while recognizing that there was a justification for what she had done - make this de-scription so absorbing a scene as we see a play or read a novel. And life, but by how he describes it becomes art, and art and genius of a day laborer, someone who chooses not to assign himself the <em>beau r√¥le</em>."</p>

<p>Claire Tomalin also argues in his biography that what marks the difference between the diaries of Samuel Pepys and other diaries from the same era, which also speak of politi-ca, travel and spiritual life "and that even those that give some details on the domestic life are discrete references in the discussions between couples. "For the biographer, what is "extraordinary" in Pepys, and he went into areas that nobody else in season remember to leave written for posterity.</p>

<p>Important and also his testimony, his Torico crucial to the knowledge of the perio-restoration. During the decade in which Samuel Pepys kept a diary several tragedies occurred in England which he saw and describes in "reporter's eye": the Great Plague of London in 1665 (the epidemic of feet in), the Great Fire of London in 1666, and the Dutch attack in Medway in 1667. As in the reign of Charles II had censorship (so there was the official <cite>London Gazette</cite>) and even the parliamentary debates could be repro-duced, "Pepys gave a public service," writes Claire Tomalin.</p>

<p>The daily reading of this version on the Web, in addition to the original text there hiperligations, notes, comments and access to discussions (which were born there), make the text more readable. "Do not make much sense to try to transform my website into a book - it works because of its links, maps, the possibility of making comments. A version of this daily published by Latham &amp; Matthews already very good and has detailed notes-lhadas and much background information," said the Briton, who has nothing to do with the applications with the diaries that have emerged in the App Store Apple.</p>

<p>In 2003, Clay Shirky, an American academic expert in new technologies, told a conference that when he learned of a decade of commitment to your Phil Gyford <cite>The Diaries of Samuel Pepys</cite>, he realized that blogs were having a long life.</p>

<p>Recently contacted by Russell M. Davies, british magazine <cite>Wired</cite>, said Gyford was visionary, the bet in 2003 (the year that arose eg the social network Friendster whom nobody speaks today) in a structure that has proved reliable. So Twitter now has over 30,000 followers. Phil did not think the explosion of social networking has had some negative effect on the blog. "I hope (but am not sure that hap-CA) that more people read Pepys on Twitter or blog." However, creditors who are not the same players in one place and another. "Sao very different experiences," he says. Also not sure that the type of interaction that readers have with the changes, the blog has over the years. "But the technologies have changed. When I started the project, it was very difficult or impossible to show ma-pas as we have now. If I knew at the time that the success wikis [the Internet pages that anyone can edit, such as Wiki-asked] would have on the possibility of collaboration for everyone, would have made more as part of a wiki encyclopedia.</p>

<p>"After the success of <cite>The Diaries of Samuel Pepys</cite>, there were other similar projects. In 2008, the Institute for the Future of the Book launched the The Golden Notebook. A group of seven writers and journalists British and American read the book <cite>The Golden Notebook</cite>, the Nobel laureate Doris Lessing, in the Web environment, and put notes on the sea-gens. Who cared if the site could read these notes, had access to a blog and discussion forum. Bob Stein, director of the institute, has defended the importance of these contents made in collaboration with readers and specialized lists. Believes that in the future, people will pay for access to the discussions of the books that go back to reading. "I never thought about the aspects of the commercial site. With all the attention paid to things like public offer for sale of Facebook, and easy to forget that many of the more interesting things and made in collaboration, and the most valuable find on the Internet, were created by love and genuine interest, not by money."</p>

<p>Sit as Russell M. Davies suggested in <cite>Wired</cite> this month, he made history with this blog? "No I have no idea, sorry. We still have to wait a long time to learn and this is the case."</p>
