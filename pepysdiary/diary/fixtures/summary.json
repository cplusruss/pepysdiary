And all I do impute almost wholly to my late temperance, since my making of my vowes against wine and plays, which keeps me most happily and contentfully to my business; which God continue!  Public matters are full of discontent, what with the sale of Dunkirk, and my Lady Castlemaine, and her faction at Court; though I know not what they would have more than to debauch the king, whom God preserve from it!  And then great plots are talked to be discovered, and all the prisons in town full of ordinary people, taken from their meeting-places last Sunday.  But for certain some plots there hath been, though not brought to a head.</p></blockquote>",

Not everything is settled however, with uncle Thomas still laying claim to property on the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/29/\">29th</a>. Also this month, the lengthy arrangements for brother <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/\">Tom's</a> marriage fell through, thanks to an error on the part of <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/662/\">Mr Cooke</a>, much to the annoyance of everyone concerned. At the <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1662/10/31/\">end of the month</a>, Pepys summarises his situation, and despite being tired of the continuing work on his home, he's otherwise happy:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In all other things as happy a man as any in the world, for the whole world seems to smile upon me, and if my house were done that I could diligently follow my business, I would not doubt to do God, and the King, and myself good service.  And all I do impute almost wholly to my late temperance, since my making of my vowes against wine and plays, which keeps me most happily and contentfully to my business; which God continue!  Public matters are full of discontent, what with the sale of Dunkirk, and my Lady Castlemaine, and her faction at Court; though I know not what they would have more than to debauch the king, whom God preserve from it!  And then great plots are talked to be discovered, and all the prisons in town full of ordinary people, taken from their meeting-places last Sunday.  But for certain some plots there hath been, though not brought to a head.</p></blockquote>",

Sam shares his concerns with Mr. Moore (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/12/\">12</a>) and then takes action by writing a letter of reproof to warn his Lordship of the gossip and perceived damage to his reputation (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/17/\">17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/18/\">18</a>).  Lord Sandwich, never one to lose his cool in a situation, addresses these issues with Sam to find out the background to the gossip and the people involved (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/22/\">22</a>). By month end, Mr. Pierce confirms with Sam that Lord Sandwich \"is resolved to go no more to Chelsy\" (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/28/\">28</a>), which is a blessing for all.</p>\n\n<p>On the home front, Elizabeth Pepys finds herself with health problems with a most painful \"hollow sore place\" and receives care from Mr. Hollyard (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/12/\">12</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/16/\">16</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/17/\">17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/18/\">18</a>). Sam hears that his former boy Wayneman has behaved so poorly with Mr. Davis that he is shipped off to Barbados (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/14/\">14</a>). Sam writes to Will's uncle to hasten his removal from the house (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/04/\">4</a>) and together they break the news to Will (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/08/\">9</a>). Sam sees a weeping Will move out by midmonth, noting as he goes to bed  \"This night I think is the first that I have lain without ever a man in my house besides myself, since I came to keep any\" (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/11/14/\">14</a>).</p>",

A very passionate story emerges of a man passing his only surviving child stark naked into the arms of a friend for safekeeping with hopes of saving the child from impending death (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/03/\">3</a>). The plague hits Sam's household with the deaths of Will Hewer's and Tom Edwards' fathers (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/15/\">15</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/21/\">21</a>), as fear lingers for Elizabeth when her father becomes ill (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/10/\">10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/12/\">12</a>).</p>\n<p>While Sam complains of his \"masters\" that \"no one is looking after business\" he busies himself with Naval news including activities in Bergen (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/05/\">5</a>), Lord Sandwich's ship military movements (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/09/\">9</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/10/\">10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/14/\">14</a>) and the poor state of the fleet regarding provisions and supplies (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/18/\">18</a>). Sam's involvement with Lord Sandwich in the selling of Prizes takes an ominous centre stage (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/17/\">17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/18/\">18</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/23/\">23</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/24/\">24</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/25/\">25</a>) and greatly improves his wealth (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/30/\">30</a>) during this time of great illness and loss to most. </p>\n<p>Sam manages to find some pleasure with a quick tryst (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/02/\">2</a>), his music (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/10/\">10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/17/\">17</a>), his reading of plays (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/07/\">7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/16/\">16</a>), and cards games and billiards (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/11/\">11</a>).  Elizabeth's artistic talent blooms with the completion of her \"picture of our Saviour, which is very pretty\" (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/27/\">27</a>).</p>",

Sam reveals an interesting glimpse into his diary writing habit when he writes that  he is \"late in the office entering my Journall for 8 days past, the greatness of my business hindering me of late to put it down daily, but I have done it now very true and particularly, and hereafter will, I hope, be able to fall into my old way of doing it daily\" ([16](http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/10/16/)).",

Sam buys himself a brass parallelogram (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/04/\">4</a>) and has a plaster made of his face (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/10/\">10</a>). </p>\n<p>Elizabeth's suspicions of Sam now center on his relationship at home with Jane.

Elizabeth is wise to be suspicious, as Sam is almost tempted when he follows a pretty lady in mourning after the burial of Captain Middleton's wife. With his watchful boy at the gate, Sam's hopes are thwarted (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/17/\">17</a>). </p>\n<p>On a very cheery note, Sam finds that his cousin Roger Pepys has quietly remarried (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/08/\">8</a>). Roger's daughters Bab and Betty arrive in town and stay with a receptive Sam (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/18/\">18</a>). Over the next days they are whisked off to plays (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/20/\">20</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/22/\">22</a>), Westminster Abbey, where they see the tomb of Katherine of Valois, the making of glass at a Glass-House (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/23/\">23</a>), and dinner at Will Hewer's impressive lodgings (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/24/\">24</a>). By the end of their adventures Sam is happily referring to them as \"my girls\" (<a href=\"http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1669/02/25/\">25</a>).</p>",
